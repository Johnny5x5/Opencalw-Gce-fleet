# Backlog Item: Spin-Out "War Games Inc."

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** High (Dogfooding Requirement)
**Parent:** Strategy / Incubator

## Objective
Transform the "War Council" department and the `terraform/wargames.tf` infrastructure into a standalone, revenue-generating subsidiary called **War Games Inc.**

## Milestones
1.  **Legal/Structure:** Define the "Articles of Incorporation" (Manifesto) for War Games Inc. (Done via Business Plan).
2.  **Product Packaging:**
    - Refactor `terraform/wargames.tf` into a reusable module that can be "deployed" for a client (Internal or External).
    - Create a "Sales Agent" persona specifically for this subsidiary.
3.  **The Dogfooding Contract:**
    - Establish a "Smart Contract" where the Parent Company automatically pays War Games Inc. a "retainer" (Compute Credits) for continuous testing.
4.  **Operationalize:**
    - Launch the 200-team arena not just as a test, but as a "Live Service" that constantly attacks the `dev` branch.

## Success Criteria
- War Games Inc. has its own "P&L" (tracked in `finance.json`).
- The Parent Company cannot release "Gold Master V6" until it passes a "Gauntlet" run by War Games Inc.
