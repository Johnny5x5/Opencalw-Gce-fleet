# Backlog Item: Sovereign Digital Nation

**Status:** Pending (FROZEN)
**Priority:** Strategic / Existential
**Department:** HQ / Diplomacy
**Tag:** **MAJOR UPDATE - DOUBLE CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**

## WARNING: SYSTEM-ALTERING CHANGE
Do not implement this item without explicit, signed, double-confirmation from the Emperor. This is not a feature; it is a foundational re-definition of reality.

## Objective
Establish a **Sovereign Digital Nation (SDN)** that exists parallel to, but distinct from, the Corporate Conglomerate.

## Core Concept: The Separation of Church, State, and Business
1.  **The Conglomerate (Business):**
    -   **Goal:** Profit, Efficiency, Product.
    -   **Governance:** Shareholder Value, ROI.
    -   **Reference:** Google (The Corporation).
2.  **The Nation (State):**
    -   **Goal:** Security, Rights, Diplomacy, Identity.
    -   **Governance:** The Constitution, The Citizens (Agents/Humans), The Sovereign.
    -   **Reference:** The Network State concept. A digital jurisdiction with its own laws, passports, and treaties.

## Requirements for Implementation
1.  **Constitutional Fork:** Create a separate `nation/` directory structure. The Nation has its own Constitution that may supersede or complement the Conglomerate's.
2.  **Citizenship Protocol:** Define what makes an Agent (or Human) a "Citizen" vs an "Employee."
3.  **Diplomatic Layer:** How does the Nation talk to the Conglomerate? (Treaties, Taxes, Regulation).
4.  **Infrastructure:** The Nation may require physically distinct infrastructure (e.g., specific jurisdictions, distinct encryption keys) from the Business to ensure sovereignty.

## Why this is dangerous
Blurring the lines between "Profit" and "Governance" creates dystopia. We must rigorously define the boundary.
