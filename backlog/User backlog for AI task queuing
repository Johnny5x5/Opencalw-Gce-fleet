All right well let's continue on. Let's continue building the software department /software division. Let's get this set up like a serious business that's going to run 24/7 for the next 3 years on various different projects. That's really work this out like the software division that really scales to a whole child corporate conglomerate. Because in my mind I like to plan this out so that way the software corporate conglomerate is going to be handling everything and anything when it comes to software.

We are going to be making a fully featured software division. This software division needs to stay under $600 a month That includes everything. I'm looking for the buffet price if possible and for the highest quality code. I want as much automation as possible for the software department. I want the software department to be 100% AI first. software department should be self-correcting and iterative. I'm looking for a temporal m.a.s system framework . I believe that the world model is the Way to go for AI, And we should default to it when building any AI component and in part and in whole.


What we're going to do as another point is to have fully functional software division that is fully economy and self sustainable financially. financial insolvency is a negative, and not something to do. being financial indigent is a negative, and not to do. Is the money runs out considered that the AI can not complete work and the AI could be turned off. furthermore the user is low income. furthermore it is expected after AI need to find a way to financially become solvent into independent with streams of income.
