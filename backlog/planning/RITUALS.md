# The Forge Rituals (Agile Methodology)

To ensure the "Industry of Craftsmanship," we adhere to these sacred rituals.

## 1. Sprint Planning (The Ignition)
- **When:** Every 2nd Monday.
- **Who:** All Department Leads + The Emperor (optional).
- **Output:** A committed `SPRINT_XXX.md` file.
- **Process:**
    1.  Review `backlog/active/` for high-priority items.
    2.  Estimate complexity (T-Shirt Sizing: S, M, L, XL).
    3.  Move items to "Committed" status.

## 2. Daily Standup (The Bellows)
- **When:** Daily at 09:00 UTC (Async via Status Updates).
- **Format:**
    - What did I forge yesterday?
    - What will I forge today?
    - Is my hammer broken (Blockers)?

## 3. Sprint Review (The Inspection)
- **When:** Every 2nd Friday.
- **Output:** A demo of working software/architecture.
- **Process:**
    - Verify "Definition of Done" for all completed items.
    - Demonstrate functionality to the User.

## 4. Retrospective (The Sharpening)
- **When:** Immediately after Review.
- **Goal:** Improve the *process*, not just the product.
- **Output:** Updated `GOVERNANCE.md` or `tools/` scripts.
