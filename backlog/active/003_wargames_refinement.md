# Title: War Games Refinement
# Priority: High
# Type: Feature
# Prime Directive: Defense

## Description
The current War Games simulation is functional but lacks depth. We need to introduce more strategic elements to better simulate real-world conflict and resource management.

## Objectives
- [ ] Add "Resource Nodes" to the map that teams can capture.
- [ ] Implement "Fog of War" to hide enemy movements.
- [ ] Introduce "Special Ops" missions for covert actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Teams can capture nodes.
- [ ] Points are awarded for holding nodes.
- [ ] Fog of War is visual on the frontend.
