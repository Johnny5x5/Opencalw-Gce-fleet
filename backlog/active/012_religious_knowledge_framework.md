# Backlog Item: Religious Knowledge Framework (The Pantheon)

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Medium (Business Intelligence)
**Department:** Global Intelligence / HR / Marketing

## Objective
Establish a structured, Wikipedia-style database ("The Pantheon") documenting world religions, belief systems, and their intersection with business, economics, and human behavior.

## The Why (Business Case)
Faith is a primary driver of human behavior. It influences:
1.  **Buying Power & Decisions:** Halal/Kosher requirements, holiday spending, boycotts.
2.  **Workforce Dynamics:** Holidays, prayer schedules, work ethic, interpersonal taboos.
3.  **Loyalty & Networking:** Community bonds that transcend corporate structures.
4.  **Geopolitics:** Understanding regional conflicts and alliances.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Structure (`src/knowledge/religions/`)
We will create a JSON/Markdown schema to document each faith neutrally.

*   **Core Beliefs:** What drives the adherent's worldview?
*   **Calendar:** Key holidays (e.g., Ramadan, Christmas, Yom Kippur) affecting productivity or sales.
*   **Dietary/Lifestyle:** Restrictions affecting catering, events, or product design.
*   **Economic Principles:** Views on interest (Usury), charity (Zakat/Tithing), and wealth.
*   **Business Etiquette:** How to respectfully negotiate or partner.

### 2. The Wikipedia Model
*   **Agent Role:** A "Cultural Anthropologist" agent will maintain this knowledge base, updating it with verified information.
*   **Neutrality:** The AI does not *adopt* these beliefs. It *studies* them to navigate the human world effectively.

### 3. Application
*   **Marketing:** Tailor campaigns to cultural/religious contexts.
*   **HR:** Automate holiday accommodation and prevent discrimination.
*   **Sales:** Avoid cultural faux pas in negotiations.
