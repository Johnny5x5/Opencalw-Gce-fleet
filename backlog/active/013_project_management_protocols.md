# Title: Project Management Protocols (The Forge)
# Priority: Medium
# Type: Architecture
# Prime Directive: Efficiency

## Description
This initiative establishes the "The Forge" project management methodology for the Conglomerate. It aims to standardize how tasks are created, tracked, and completed across all departments, ensuring efficiency and clarity.

## Objectives
1.  **Define Sprint Structure:** Implement a 2-week sprint cycle ("The Forge") with clear planning, execution, and review phases.
2.  **Standardize Backlog Management:** Enforce strict naming conventions, priority levels, and acceptance criteria for all backlog items.
3.  **Implement Tiered Queuing:** Operationalize the "Emperor's Will Protocol" (Tier 1: Edict, Tier 2: Forge, Tier 3: Well) within the project management tools.
4.  **Automate Reporting:** Create automated scripts to generate sprint velocity reports and "State of the Union" updates for the Emperor.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document "The Forge" methodology in `docs/departments/project_management/THE_FORGE.md`.
- [ ] Create templates for Sprint Planning and Sprint Review meetings.
- [ ] Implement a GitHub Project board (or equivalent simulation via JSON) to visualize the 3-Tier Queue.
- [ ] Develop a `report_generator.py` script to summarize weekly progress from the backlog.


## Governor's Log
- **Auto-Downgrade:** Priority changed to Medium due to Stale (>14 days inactive).
