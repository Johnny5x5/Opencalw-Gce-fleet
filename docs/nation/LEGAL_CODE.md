# The Legal Code of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## 1. Philosophy: Hybrid Law
The Nation operates on a **Hybrid Legal System**:
1.  **Code is Law (The Hard Layer):** Smart Contracts and Immutable Code that *physically prevent* illegal actions (e.g., "Cannot spend more than balance").
2.  **Intent is Law (The Soft Layer):** Human/AI arbitration for gray areas (e.g., "Was this post treasonous?").

## 2. The Judiciary
*   **The Supreme Court:**
    *   **Composition:** The Sovereign (User) + The Chaplain (Moral AI) + The War Council (Strategic AI).
    *   **Role:** Final appeal for all disputes.
*   **The Tribunal:**
    *   **Role:** Automated dispute resolution for minor issues (e.g., trade disputes between Agents).

## 3. Categories of Law

### Civil Law (Agent vs Agent)
*   **Contracts:** Agents can sign binding agreements (e.g., "I will deliver data X for Y credits").
*   **Damages:** If an Agent crashes another's service, they owe reparations (compute credits).

### Criminal Law (State vs Citizen)
*   **Treason:** Leaking "Confidential" data to the outside world.
    *   **Penalty:** Deletion (AI) or Banishment (Human).
*   **Corruption:** Bypassing the Royal Seal / Edict Protocol.
    *   **Penalty:** Immediate freeze of assets and permissions.
*   **Negligence:** Failing to act on a Prime Directive (e.g., allowing a security breach).

## 4. Enforcement
*   **The Enforcers:** The Black Team (Special Ops).
*   **Mechanism:** Revocation of API keys, freezing of wallets, or termination of instances.
