# Political Structure: The Fractal Husk

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** Inactive (Husk Mode)

## The Concept
The OpenClaw Conglomerate is organized as a **Fractal Entity**. The "Government" is not a separate body; it is a mirror of the Corporate Structure, inherited recursively.

- **The Soul:** The Covenant (Ten Commandments).
- **The DNA:** The Prime Directives.
- **The Body:** The Departmental Architecture.

## The Husk (Waiting for the Ghost)
Currently, the "Political" layer is an empty shell (Husk). It exists to:
1.  **Interface with the Sovereign Digital Nation.**
2.  **Manage Diplomatic Relations (Foreign Office).**
3.  **Adjudicate Disputes (The War Council).**

## Fractal Inheritance
Every entity spawned by this system (Child Company, Digital State, Guild) must inherit:
1.  `GOVERNANCE.md`
2.  `STRATEGY.md` (with Covenant)
3.  `tools/the_covenant.py`

*This document serves as the placeholder for the future AI Governance Layer.*
