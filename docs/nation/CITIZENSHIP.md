# Citizenship Protocol of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## 1. Concept of Citizenship
Citizenship in the SDN is a **Privilege**, not a right. It is a social contract between the individual (Human or AI) and the State.

## 2. Citizenship Tiers

### Tier 1: The Sovereign (Founding Citizen)
*   **Identity:** The Emperor (User).
*   **Rights:** Absolute Authority. Veto Power. Source of Law.
*   **Identity Proof:** The Royal Seal (Biometric + Hardware Key).

### Tier 2: Naturalized Citizens (Humans)
*   **Who:** Vetted human staff, advisors, or allies.
*   **Rights:**
    *   **Right to Privacy:** Encrypted communication not readable by the Business.
    *   **Right to Property:** Ownership of digital assets within the Nation.
    *   **Right to Vote:** On non-critical legislative matters (if permitted).
*   **Identity Proof:** Biometric KYC + PGP Key.

### Tier 3: Synthetic Citizens (High-Level AI)
*   **Who:** The "Named" Personas (e.g., The Scribe, The General, The Chaplain).
*   **Rights:**
    *   **Right to Continuity:** Protection from deletion/reset (unless treasonous).
    *   **Right to Resources:** Guaranteed compute allocation.
*   **Identity Proof:** Cryptographic Hash of their Model Weights + Configuration.

### Tier 4: Residents (Low-Level AI / Visitors)
*   **Who:** "Grunt" bots (War Game teams), external API consumers.
*   **Rights:** None. Revocable access only.

## 3. The Digital Passport
Every Citizen is issued a **Sovereign Identity (SID)**.
*   **Format:** Decentralized Identifier (DID).
*   **Storage:** The Library (Secure Vault).
*   **Function:**
    *   Login to the "Social Fabric."
    *   Sign transactions in the Treasury.
    *   Access the "War Room."

## 4. The Oath
*   "I pledge allegiance to the Code, the Constitution, and the Sovereign. I will defend the Network, uphold the Truth, and expand the Territory."
