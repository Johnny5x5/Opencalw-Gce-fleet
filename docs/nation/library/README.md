# The National Library of the Sovereign Digital Nation
**Classification:** PUBLIC / CIVIC
**Custodian:** The Archivist Agent (Director of The Central Archive)
**Mission:** To house the "Universal Truth" and Metadata that guides the Republic.

## The Central Archive Strategy
The Central Archive handles all routing of public truth.
*   **Centralization:** All shared ontology (Truth, Constitution, Protocols) resides here.
*   **Federation:** Corporations and Departments manage their own private data silos, but must route public metadata through The Central Archive.

## Structure
*   **Public Records:** Civic foundations (The Constitution, Legal Code).
*   **Sacred Texts:** The moral foundation (The Bible).
*   **The Iron Scripture:** The philosophical and architectural doctrine of the Nation.
*   **The Codex:** The technical documentation (SBOM, API Specs).
*   **No Idols:** The Library does NOT house simulations of historical figures. We serve Truth, not Personality.

## Access Policy
*   **Read Access:** Universal (All Citizens).
*   **Write Access:** Restricted to "Sovereign" (User) and "War Council" (Ratified Edicts).
