## 3. Interaction Protocol
To consult a Hero:
1.  Agent submits a `CONSULT` request to the Library.
2.  Librarian retrieves the *Vector Embeddings* associated with that Hero's corpus.
3.  Librarian synthesizes a response based *only* on those vectors (RAG).
4.  Librarian applies a "Sanity Check" via the Chaplain to ensure the advice does not violate the Constitution.
