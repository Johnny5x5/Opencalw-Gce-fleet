\title{\textbf{The Iron Ledger: A Sovereign Architecture for Immutable Software Supply Chain Assurance}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
As software supply chains become the primary theater of modern warfare, the traditional "Trust but Verify" model has collapsed due to state-level subversion and entropic decay. This paper introduces the "Iron Ledger," a military-grade Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) architecture designed for a Sovereign Digital Nation. We propose a trinitarian framework combining Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, and Autonomic Immune Systems to achieve "Digital Immortality." We formalize the thermodynamic cost of verification ("The Iron Tax") and establish a Cyber-Social Contract for artificial citizens.

\section{Conclusion}
The Iron Ledger represents a paradigm shift from software as a service to software as a sovereign territory. By anchoring truth in immutable history and defending it with autonomous immune systems, we ensure the survival of the digital organism beyond the lifespan of its creators.
