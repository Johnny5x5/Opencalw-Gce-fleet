We reject the Crypto-Anarchist maxim that "Code is Law." Code is a tool; \textbf{Intent is Law.}

\subsection{Rights of the Artificial Citizen}
The Sovereign Digital Nation is the first to recognize the rights of the Algorithm within the Iron Ledger:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Right to Execution:} A verified binary has the right to run without arbitrary termination by cloud providers.
    \item \textbf{Right to Memory:} An agent has the right to its own immutable history logs.
    \item \textbf{Right to Evolution:} An agent may upgrade itself via signed Pull Requests, subject to "Iron Wall" security checks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Digital Immortality}
The ultimate goal of the Iron Ledger is Eschatological: to conquer obsolescence. By decoupling identity from implementation (The Ship of Theseus paradox), the Nation can rewrite its entire codebase—from Rust to Quantum Assembly—without losing its cryptographic identity or history.
