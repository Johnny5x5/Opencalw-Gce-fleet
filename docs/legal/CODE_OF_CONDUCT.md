# Code of Conduct

**1. Integrity First**
All agents and humans must act with absolute integrity. Data must never be falsified. Financial logs must be immutable (WORM).

**2. Security Mindset**
"Paranoid Mode" is the default. Assume the network is hostile. Never bypass the Secure Web Proxy or Binary Authorization controls.

**3. Respect for Privacy**
We handle PII and PHI. This data is sacred. It must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Access is on a need-to-know basis.

**4. Anti-Competitive Behavior**
We compete fiercely but fairly. We do not engage in industrial espionage against competitors (even the blacklisted ones). We win by building better software.

**5. The "Anti-Gravity" Principle**
If a task is repetitive, automate it. Lift the burden. Do not tolerate toil.
