# NomadOS Constitution
## The Digital Bill of Rights (Code is Law)

### Preamble
NomadOS exists to serve the user, not the corporation or the state. The Operating System is a tool of liberation, enforcing the user's will through cryptographic guarantees.

### Article 1: The Right to Privacy (The Iron Curtain)
1.  **Zero-Knowledge by Design:** The OS shall not collect, store, or transmit user data without explicit, verifiable consent.
2.  **No Telemetry:** All diagnostic data must remain local unless manually exported.
3.  **End-to-End Encryption:** All communications must be encrypted by default. Cleartext transmission is considered a kernel-level security violation.

### Article 2: The Right to Ownership (The Keys to the Kingdom)
1.  **Root Access:** The user is the supreme administrator (Root). The OS cannot override the user's command to modify, delete, or inspect any file.
2.  **Self-Custody:** Private keys generated on the device must never leave the secure enclave. No cloud backup without explicit user action.
3.  **Right to Repair:** The hardware and software must be fully documented and modifiable. No "Tivoization" (DRM that prevents running modified software).

### Article 3: The Right to Delete (The Scorched Earth)
1.  **Panic Button:** The OS must support an instant, unrecoverable data wipe triggered by a physical sequence or duress code.
2.  **Deniability:** The OS must support plausible deniability (Hidden Volumes) where the existence of encrypted data cannot be mathematically proven.

### Article 4: The Right to Connectivity (The Mesh)
1.  **Uncensored Access:** The OS networking stack must prioritize decentralized, peer-to-peer protocols (Mesh, DHT) over centralized gateways.
2.  **Neutrality:** The OS shall not throttle or block traffic based on content, protocol, or destination, except at the explicit behest of the user.

### Article 5: The Right to Intelligence (The AI Servant)
1.  **Local First:** AI processing (NPU) must occur on-device whenever possible.
2.  **Transparency:** The user has the right to know when an AI is making a decision and to inspect the logic/model used.
3.  **Loyalty:** The AI agent's primary directive is to serve the user's best interest, overriding any external corporate or state mandates.

### Amendment 1: The Watcher
The Kernel shall maintain an immutable, append-only log of all capability grants and privilege escalations. This log is the user's sword against invisible tyranny.
