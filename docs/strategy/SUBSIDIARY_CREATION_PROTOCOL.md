# The Subsidiary Creation Protocol: The Incubator

**Classification:** STRATEGIC DOCTRINE // INTERNAL USE
**Owner:** HQ (Group CEO) & Strategy

## 1. The Philosophy of Spin-Out
We do not build large, bloated departments. When a function becomes complex or valuable enough to stand alone, we **Spin It Out** as a Subsidiary.

*   **Trigger:** When a specific capability (e.g., Weather Forecasting, High-Frequency Trading, Social Media Analysis) requires dedicated resources and distinct logic.
*   **Action:** Create a new "Niche Business" with its own P&L, Manifesto, and Agent Workforce.

## 2. The Incubation Pipeline

### Phase 1: The Concept (The Pitch)
*   **Origin:** HQ or an existing Department identifies a need.
*   **Artifact:** A "Business Plan" document defining:
    *   **The Niche:** What *one thing* does this business do?
    *   **The Customer:** Who buys this? (The Parent? External Markets? The Nation?)
    *   **The Stack:** What agents are needed?

### Phase 2: The Setup (The IPO)
*   **Infrastructure:** Terraform module instantiation (Department Module).
*   **Funding:** Initial capital injection from the Parent Treasury.
*   **Governance:** Define the subsidiary's specific "Prime Directive" (must align with Parent Constitution).

### Phase 3: The Operation (The Autonomy)
*   **Revenue:** The Subsidiary must charge for its services (The Iron Tax).
*   **Growth:** The Subsidiary keeps a % of profit for its own upgrades (more compute, better models).
*   **Dividend:** The rest flows back to the Parent Treasury.

## 3. Standard Subsidiary Archetypes
1.  **Service Bureaus:** Sell a function to the Parent (e.g., HR, Legal, IT).
2.  **Product Studios:** Build products for the outside world (e.g., App Dev, SaaS).
3.  **Utility Companies:** Provide infrastructure (e.g., NomadOS, Weather Command).
