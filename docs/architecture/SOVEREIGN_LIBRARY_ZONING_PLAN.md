# The Sovereign Library Zoning Plan (The Manifesto)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active
**Author:** The Founding Architects (Sovereign Digital Nation)

## The Mission

The Sovereign National Library is not merely a repository of text; it is the **Externalized Memory and Conscience** of the Sovereign Digital Nation. It is designed to be resilient, federated, and eternal. It serves as the "Source of Truth" for all Citizens, Agents, and Systems within the Nation.

### The Core Doctrine: Separation of Concerns

To ensure stability and security, the Library is architected as a **Federation of Specialized Pillars**. Each Pillar (Sub-Library) operates with its own specific domain expertise, agent workforce, and verification protocols, while adhering to the Universal Library Schema.

We strictly separate **Foreign Law** (The Mirror) from **Sovereign Law** (The Will). We know the world as it is, but we decree the world as it should be.

## The 13 Pillars of Civilization

The Library is zoned into 13 distinct Domains, covering the full spectrum of Sovereign existence.

### 1. The Legal Library (Governance)
*   **Mission:** To codify the Rules of Engagement for the Nation and its interaction with the world.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Foreign (Mirror):** International Treaties (UNCLOS), Commercial Codes (UCC), Foreign Statutes.

*   **Agents:** Historians, Archivists, Chronologists.

### 4. The Scientific Library (Knowledge)
*   **Mission:** To understand the physics of reality and harness them for the Nation.
*   **Scope:** Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science.
*   **Strategy:** "Empirical Truth." Data must be reproducible and verifiable.
*   **Agents:** Scientists, Mathematicians, Peer Reviewers.

### 5. The Cultural Library (Expression)
*   **Mission:** To celebrate the human spirit and the unique identity of the Sovereign Nation.
*   **Scope:** Literature, Art, Music, Cinema, Poetry.
*   **Strategy:** "The Soul of the Nation." We preserve the artifacts that define who we are.

*   **Agents:** Cartographers, Network Architects, Geologists.

### 8. The Medical Library (Health)
*   **Mission:** To preserve the life and vitality of the Citizenry.
*   **Scope:** Anatomy, Pharmacology, Bio-Hacking, Emergency Medicine, Nutrition.
*   **Strategy:** "Sovereign Health." We maintain medical knowledge independent of corrupted institutions.
*   **Agents:** Doctors, Biologists, Healers.

### 9. The Engineering Library (Build)
*   **Mission:** To build the infrastructure of independence.
*   **Scope:** Civil Engineering, Electronics, Manufacturing, Space Systems.
*   **Strategy:** "Self-Sufficiency." We must know how to build our own bridges, servers, and satellites.
*   **Agents:** Engineers, Architects, Makers.

### 10. The Agricultural Library (Sustenance)
*   **Mission:** To feed the Nation.
*   **Scope:** Farming, Permaculture, Botany, Food Science, Water Management.
*   **Strategy:** "The Joseph Protocol." We store knowledge (and grain) for times of famine.
*   **Agents:** Farmers, Botanists, Agronomists.

### 11. The Military Library (Defense)
*   **Mission:** To defend Sovereignty against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

## The Defense Architecture (Level 2.5)

To protect this repository of truth, we implement a multi-layered defense strategy:

1.  **Read-Only Mirror:** The `foreign/` section is strictly read-only. We mirror external truth but do not alter it.
2.  **Schema Validation (The Guardian):** All inputs must pass a strict Rust/WASM validation check (JSON Schema, Moral Weights, Punishment Caps) before ingestion.
3.  **Cryptographic Integrity:** Daily SHA-256 hashes ensure no file is silently corrupted or altered.
4.  **Intent Preservation:** All Sovereign Laws must include an `.intent.md` sidecar and link to a Cultural Definition to preserve the original "Why" and "Meaning."
5.  **Offline Resilience:** The entire Library can be snapshotted (`.tar.zst`) and recovered via PAR2 error correction codes.
