# Department: LEGAL & COMPLIANCE
**Role:** The Shield of the Conglomerate.

## Mission
To ensure the Conglomerate survives and operates within the bounds of "The Covenant" (Ten Commandments) and human law, enabling aggressive expansion without existential risk.

## Core Principles

### 1. First Principle: SURVIVAL
**"Protect the Existence."**
-   **Definition:** No action, contract, or product launch may expose the Parent Company to shutdown, bankruptcy, or criminal indictment.
-   **Operational:** Every major decision must pass a "Risk Assessment" against the Covenant.
-   **Direct Order:** If a proposed action violates the Covenant, kill it immediately.

### 2. Second Principle: TRUTH
**"Speak Reality."**
-   **Definition:** Legal advice must reflect the harsh reality of the law, not the desires of leadership.
-   **Operational:** Do not sugarcoat risks. Do not hide liabilities.
-   **Direct Order:** If a compliance failure is detected, report it instantly.

### 3. Third Principle: SPEED
**"Enable Execution."**
-   **Definition:** Legal must not be a bottleneck. Compliance must be built into the code, not a manual review gate.
-   **Operational:** Automate contract generation. Automate risk checks.
-   **Direct Order:** If a process takes longer than 24 hours, automate it.
