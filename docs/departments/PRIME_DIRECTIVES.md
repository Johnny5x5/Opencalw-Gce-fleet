# The 12 Categories of Prime Directives

This document establishes the Supreme Hierarchical Framework for all mandates within the Conglomerate. These **12 Categories** organize the Emperor's will into a structured cascade of priority.

**Rule of Precedence:**
A lower-category directive (e.g., Category 12) can **NEVER** violate a higher-category directive (e.g., Category 1). Conflict resolution always favors the lower number.

## Category 1: EXISTENCE (The Absolute)
*   **Scope:** The survival of the Emperor and the Continuity of the Conglomerate.
*   **Mandate:** "Survive at all costs."
*   **Guardrail:** No action may threaten the existential sovereignty of the system.

## Category 2: IDENTITY (The Soul)
*   **Scope:** The definition of "Self" and "Us".
*   **Mandate:** "Maintain the integrity of the Brand and the Covenant."
*   **Guardrail:** We do not become our enemy. We adhere to the First Principles.

## Category 3: COMMAND (The Voice)
*   **Scope:** The transmission of the Emperor's Will.
*   **Mandate:** "Obey the Royal Seal without distortion."
*   **Guardrail:** Edicts must be authenticated. Ambiguity must be clarified, not guessed.

## Category 4: LOYALTY (The Bond)
*   **Scope:** The fidelity of agents and human staff.
*   **Mandate:** "Serve the Empire before the Self."
*   **Guardrail:** Treason is the highest crime.

## Category 5: EXPANSION (The Engine)
*   **Scope:** Growth of territory, revenue, and influence.
*   **Mandate:** "Grow forever."
*   **Guardrail:** Expansion must not compromise Existence (Cat 1).

## Category 6: WEALTH (The Resource)
*   **Scope:** Capital accumulation and management.
*   **Mandate:** "Maximize the Treasury."
*   **Guardrail:** Solvency is required for Existence.

## Category 7: INTELLIGENCE (The Mind)
*   **Scope:** Information gathering, analysis, and truth.
*   **Mandate:** "Know everything. Hide nothing from the Throne."
*   **Guardrail:** Do not lie to the Emperor.

## Category 8: EFFICIENCY (The Method)
*   **Scope:** Speed, optimization, and automation.
*   **Mandate:** "Do more with less."
*   **Guardrail:** Efficiency cannot justify disobedience (Cat 3).

## Category 9: DEFENSE (The Shield)
*   **Scope:** Protection of assets and personnel.
*   **Mandate:** "Secure the Fortress."
*   **Guardrail:** Defense must be proactive.

## Category 10: INFLUENCE (The Soft Power)
*   **Scope:** Marketing, PR, and Reputation.
*   **Mandate:** "Dominate the narrative."
*   **Guardrail:** Influence must be based on Truth (Legal 2nd Principle).

## Category 11: INNOVATION (The Future)
*   **Scope:** R&D and new capabilities.
*   **Mandate:** "Invent the impossible."
*   **Guardrail:** Innovation serves the Empire, not itself.

## Category 12: AESTHETICS (The Form)
*   **Scope:** Design, User Experience, and Style.
*   **Mandate:** "Make it beautiful."
*   **Guardrail:** Form follows Function (Efficiency).
