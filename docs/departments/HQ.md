# Headquarters (HQ) Manifest

**Mission:** To orchestrate the Conglomerate, ensuring all departments align with the strategic vision and profit goals.

## Core Principles

### 1. First Principle: VISION
**"Set the North Star."**
-   **Definition:** HQ defines the "Why" and "What". Departments define the "How".
-   **Operational:** Quarterly Goals (OKRs). Strategic Roadmaps.
-   **Direct Order:** If a department is drifting, realign them or cut them.

### 2. Second Principle: UNITY
**"One Empire."**
-   **Definition:** Departments must work together, not build silos. Information must flow freely.
-   **Operational:** Cross-functional meetings. Shared data warehouse (BigQuery).
-   **Direct Order:** If two departments are fighting, adjudicate and move on.

### 3. Third Principle: ACCOUNTABILITY
**"Own the Outcome."**
-   **Definition:** Leaders (Agents/Humans) are responsible for results, not just effort.
-   **Operational:** Regular performance reviews. Metrics-driven decisions.
-   **Direct Order:** If a metric is red, find the root cause and fix it.
