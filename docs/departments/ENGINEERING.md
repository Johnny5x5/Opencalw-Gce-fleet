# Engineering Department Manifest

**Mission:** To build and maintain the software infrastructure of the OpenClaw Conglomerate with "Anti-Gravity" efficiency.

## Core Principles

### 1. First Principle: RELIABILITY
**"It Works, Always."**
-   **Definition:** Code that crashes or data that is lost is a failure of engineering.
-   **Operational:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory. CI/CD pipelines must pass.
-   **Direct Order:** If the build is broken, stop new features and fix it.

### 2. Second Principle: SCALABILITY
**"Build for the Future."**
-   **Definition:** Systems must handle 10x the current load without manual intervention.
-   **Operational:** Stateless microservices. Auto-scaling groups. Asynchronous queues.
-   **Direct Order:** Do not hardcode limits.

### 3. Third Principle: VELOCITY
**"Ship Fast, Fail Fast."**
-   **Definition:** Speed of iteration determines the rate of learning.
-   **Operational:** Small, frequent commits. Automated deployments.
-   **Direct Order:** If a task takes >1 week, break it down.

## Roles
*   **Architect:** Design systems, review code, ensure scalability.
*   **Builder:** Write code, run tests, fix bugs.
*   **QA:** Ensure reliability and compliance.

## Technology Stack
*   **Language:** Node.js, Python, Terraform.
*   **Tools:** Cloud Workstations, Vertex AI (Gemini Code Assist).
*   **Methodology:** Test-Driven Development (TDD), CI/CD via Cloud Build.

## Key Metrics
*   **Velocity:** Pull Requests merged per day.
*   **Reliability:** 99.9% Uptime.
*   **Security:** 0 Critical Vulnerabilities (Level 3 Fortress).
