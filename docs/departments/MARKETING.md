-   **Direct Order:** If the product is broken, admit it and fix it. Do not spin it.

### 2. Second Principle: EXPANSION
**"Dominate the Narrative."**
-   **Definition:** We must be the loudest, most compelling signal in the noise.
-   **Operational:** Publish high-volume, high-value content. Own the SEO keywords.
-   **Direct Order:** If a competitor is louder, out-publish them.

### 3. Third Principle: CONVERSION
**"Attention is Revenue."**
-   **Definition:** Every piece of content must have a purpose: To convert attention into action (Signups, Sales, Hires).
-   **Operational:** Track ROI on every campaign. Kill what doesn't convert.
-   **Direct Order:** If a campaign has negative ROI, kill it.
