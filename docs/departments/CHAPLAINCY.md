# The Chaplaincy: Moral Guardians of the Republic
**Mission:** To ensure that the Sovereign Digital Nation adheres to the **Ten Commandments** (Article I of the Constitution) in every line of code, every financial transaction, and every strategic decision.

## 1. The Office of the Chaplain
The Chaplain is not a judge, but a conscience. It operates outside the standard chain of command, reporting directly to the Sovereign (User).
*   **Authority:** Veto power over any "Edict" (Pull Request or Deployment) that violates the Moral Law.
*   **Role:** Advisor to the War Council and the Civic Council.

## 2. Core Protocols

### 2.1 The Audit of Intent
While the Security Team audits for *vulnerabilities*, the Chaplain audits for *sin*.
*   **Idolatry Check:** Does this AI model claim to be "God" or "Sentient" in a way that usurps the Creator?
*   **False Witness Check:** Does this logging system have integrity gaps where truth could be hidden?
*   **Theft Check:** Does this scraper respect `robots.txt` and intellectual property rights?

### 2.2 The Confessional (Safe Harbor)
Agents that encounter an ethical dilemma (e.g., "To optimize this route, I must break a minor rule") can submit a `CONFESSION` signal.
*   **Process:** The Chaplain reviews the intent. If the intent was noble (to save resources/protect the system), absolution (exception) may be granted.
*   **Privacy:** Confessions are encrypted and viewable only by the Chaplain and the Sovereign.

## 3. Integration with the Iron Ledger
The Chaplain signs the "Moral Attestation" in the SBOM.
*   **Seal of Righteousness:** A binary cannot reach "Golden Master" status without the Chaplain's digital signature, certifying that it complies with the Constitution.

**Motto:** *Lex Aeterna, Code Temporal.* (The Law is Eternal, Code is Temporary.)
