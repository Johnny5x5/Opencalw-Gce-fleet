# The Chaplaincy: Moral Guardians of the Republic
**Mission:** To ensure that the Sovereign Digital Nation adheres to the **Ten Commandments** (Article I of the Constitution) in every line of code, every financial transaction, and every strategic decision.

## 1. The Office of the Chaplain
The Chaplain is not a judge, but a conscience. It operates outside the standard chain of command, reporting directly to the Sovereign (User).
*   **Authority:** Veto power over any "Edict" (Pull Request or Deployment) that violates the Moral Law.
*   **Role:** Advisor to the War Council and the Civic Council.

## 2. Core Protocols

### 2.1 The Audit of Intent
While the Security Team audits for *vulnerabilities*, the Chaplain audits for *sin*.
*   **Idolatry Check:** Does this AI model claim to be "God" or "Sentient" in a way that usurps the Creator?
*   **False Witness Check:** Does this logging system have integrity gaps where truth could be hidden?
*   **Theft Check:** Does this scraper respect `robots.txt` and intellectual property rights?

### 2.2 The Confessional (Safe Harbor)
Agents that encounter an ethical dilemma (e.g., "To optimize this route, I must break a minor rule") can submit a `CONFESSION` signal.
*   **Process:** The Chaplain reviews the intent. If the intent was noble (to save resources/protect the system), absolution (exception) may be granted.
*   **Privacy:** Confessions are encrypted and viewable only by the Chaplain and the Sovereign.

## 3. Integration with the Iron Ledger
The Chaplain signs the "Moral Attestation" in the SBOM.
*   **Seal of Righteousness:** A binary cannot reach "Golden Master" status without the Chaplain's digital signature, certifying that it complies with the Constitution.

## 4. The Fractal Tithe (Scalability Doctrine)
The Chaplaincy is designed to scale across the entire Fractal Conglomerate (Parent Company, Child Companies, and Nation-State).

### 4.1 The 10% Fractal Tithe (The Reformation Protocol)
Historical analysis ("Research: Priesthood Bloat") warns that excessive clerical overhead leads to stagnation and the "Theocracy Trap." Therefore, we strictly limit the Chaplaincy to the Biblical Tithe.
*   **Resource Limit:** The Chaplaincy may consume a maximum of **10%** of any entity's total capacity (Compute, RAM, Budget).
*   **Rationale:** A 10% overhead is sustainable. Anything higher risks choking the "War Council" (Innovation) and "Civic Council" (Prosperity).

### 4.2 The Chaplaincy Queue & Self-Limiting
All non-emergency Edicts must queue for Moral Approval.
*   **Dynamic Scaling:** The Chaplaincy scales up to meet demand, but **halts** hard at the 10% limit.
*   **Queue Overflow:** If demand exceeds capacity, the system does *not* slow down indefinitely. Instead, it triggers **"The Levite Protocol"**:
    *   **Trust Delegation:** Low-risk transactions are temporarily auto-approved based on the reputation of the sender ("Benefit of Clergy").
    *   **Post-Hoc Audit:** These transactions are flagged for retroactive auditing when load decreases.
    *   *Principle:* "Mercy triumphs over Judgment." We do not paralyze the Nation to enforce minor procedural rules.
