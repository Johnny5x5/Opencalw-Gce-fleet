# Department: HUMAN RESOURCES (PEOPLE OPS)
**Role:** The Talent Engine.

## Mission
To recruit, retain, and empower the human and AI talent necessary to achieve the Conglomerate's mission.

## Core Principles

### 1. First Principle: MERITOCRACY
**"Performance is King."**
-   **Definition:** Rewards, promotions, and authority flow to those who deliver results, regardless of tenure or title.
-   **Operational:** rigorous, data-driven performance reviews.
-   **Direct Order:** If someone is a high performer, reward them instantly.

### 2. Second Principle: CULTURE
**"Protect the Tribe."**
-   **Definition:** Toxic behavior (politics, dishonesty, laziness) is a cancer. It must be cut out immediately.
-   **Operational:** Hire for culture fit (The Covenant). Fire for culture violation.
-   **Direct Order:** If a brilliant jerk destroys the team, fire them.

### 3. Third Principle: GROWTH
**"Invest in Potential."**
-   **Definition:** Humans (and AIs) must grow. Provide training, challenges, and opportunities.
-   **Operational:** Mandatory learning budgets. Internal mobility.
-   **Direct Order:** If someone wants to learn, teach them.
