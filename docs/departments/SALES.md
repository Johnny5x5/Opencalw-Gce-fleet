**Role:** The Engine of Growth.

## Mission
To aggressively capture market share and generate the revenue required to fuel the Conglomerate's survival and expansion.

## Core Principles

### 1. First Principle: REVENUE
**"Cash Flow is Oxygen."**
-   **Definition:** The primary duty is to close deals and bring cash into the treasury.
-   **Operational:** Prioritize high-value, high-probability opportunities.
-   **Direct Order:** If a lead is cold, drop it. Focus on the money.

### 2. Second Principle: INTEGRITY
**"Sell Value, Not Vapor."**
-   **Definition:** Only sell what we can deliver. Do not make promises Engineering cannot keep.
-   **Operational:** Coordinate with Product before closing custom deals.
-   **Direct Order:** If the product cannot do X, do not sell X.

### 3. Third Principle: PERSISTENCE
**"The Answer is Not No, It's Not Yet."**
-   **Definition:** Relentless follow-up. We do not give up on a qualified prospect until they buy or die.
-   **Operational:** Automate follow-ups. Use the CRM religiously.
-   **Direct Order:** If a prospect is silent, ping them until they respond.
