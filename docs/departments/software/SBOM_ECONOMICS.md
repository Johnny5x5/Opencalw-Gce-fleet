# SBOM Macro-Economics (The "Iron Tax")
**Classification:** Internal Business Strategy
**Objective:** Transform the SBOM from a "Cost Center" into a "Revenue Generator" and "Risk Mitigator" for the Conglomerate.

## 1. Internal Chargeback Model (The "Safety Tax")
Every department utilizing the "Iron Ledger" for component verification pays a micro-transaction fee to the Software Division.
*   **Verification Fee:** $0.0001 per artifact verification (deducted from Department Budget).
*   **Analysis Fee:** $0.01 per deep vulnerability scan (e.g., CVE impact analysis).
*   **Rationale:** This incentivizes departments to keep their dependency trees lean (fewer dependencies = lower tax).

## 2. External Revenue Streams (Sovereign Licensing)
The "Iron Ledger" is a product offered to the citizens of the Digital Nation and external partners.
*   **"Trusted Supply Chain" Certification:** External entities can pay to have their software signed and verified by our Authority.
    *   **Cost:** Tiered subscription (Gold/Platinum/Sovereign).
    *   **Benefit:** Access to the "Fast Lane" in our network; trusted execution on NomadOS devices.
*   **Vulnerability Intelligence Feed:** Selling our curated, AI-enriched CVE/VEX data stream to external security firms.

## 3. Automated Legal Defense (Risk Mitigation)
The SBOM acts as an automated lawyer for Intellectual Property compliance.
*   **License Incompatibility Detection:** Automatically flags "Viral" licenses (e.g., AGPL) attempting to link with "Proprietary" core logic.
*   **Calculated Exposure:** The AI estimates the potential legal damages of a violation based on codebase size and revenue.
*   **Bounty Program:** The system pays a small "bounty" to any sub-agent that identifies a hidden license violation in a 3rd party dependency.

## 4. The "Golden Master" Asset Class
Verified, vulnerability-free, Long-Term Support (LTS) binaries are treated as "Digital Assets".
*   **Storage:** Stored in the "Vault" (Cold Storage).
*   **Valuation:** The "value" of a Golden Master increases over time as it proves its stability and security (Lindy Effect).
*   **Liquidation:** In a crisis, Golden Masters can be licensed to desperate actors needing guaranteed-secure software.
