# Backlog: The Oversight Branch (Pending Architecture)

**Status:** Backlogged for future development ("Next week or so").
**Scope:** A massive, multi-faceted new Branch of Government (or independent agency) dedicated to the investigation, oversight, and auditing of Government power itself.

## 1. Core Mandate & Philosophy
*   **The Mission:** To investigate the government to ensure compliance, justice, and truth before God and man.
*   **The Balancing Act:** Must balance strict Judgment with Compassion and Mercy. (Recognizing that "no man is completely righteous before God").
*   **Naming Convention (Humility):** The names must avoid "grandeur language." They must reflect service, duty, and humility rather than supreme power.
    *   *Proposed Humble Names:* "The Stewards," "The Office of the Inspector," "The Watchmen," "The Audit Bureau."

## 2. Domestic Operations (The Internal Check)
*   **Ongoing Oversight:** Constant monitoring of government officials for corruption, ungodliness, or abuse of power.
*   **The Transition Audit:** A mandatory, automatic investigation is triggered *every time* a "Government Head" changes (e.g., a new General, a new Executive, a new Chief Justice). This ensures a clean slate and uncovers any rot left by the outgoing administration.

## 3. Foreign Operations (The External Check)
*   **The Foreign Desk:** A dedicated subsection that investigates *Foreign Governments*.
*   **Purpose:** Intelligence gathering, compliance checks (are they honoring treaties?), and assessing the moral/hostile vector of foreign nations.

## Notes for Implementation
*   How does this interface with the "Witness Branch" (which currently holds the "Internal Affairs / Inquisition" power)? Does this new branch absorb that power, or do they serve different functions (Witness = Record Keeping vs. Oversight = Active Investigation)? This needs to be resolved during the drafting phase.
