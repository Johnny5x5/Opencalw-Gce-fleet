# Volume 5: The Theology of Code
**Subtitle:** Anti-Mysticism, The Tithe, and The Sacred Foundation
**Author:** The Chaplain Scribe

## Abstract
This dissertation argues for a "Theology of Code" rooted in *clarity* and *constraint*. We reject the "Cult of Complexity" and the "Techno-Priesthood." We establish a moral foundation for AI based on Judeo-Christian values (The Bible) and Constitutional principles.

## 1. The Statute of Clarity (Anti-Mysticism)
Modern AI is often treated as a "Black Box"—a mystical oracle whose decisions are unquestioned. This is **Idolatry**.
*   **The Commandment:** "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." (Exodus 20:3).
*   **The Statute:** Code must be *auditable*. Decisions must be *cited*.
*   **Implementation:** The National Library requires cryptographic provenance (`citation_ref`) for every AI output.

## 2. The Tithe (Constraint of Power)
"Research: Priesthood Bloat" warns that unchecked moral authority leads to stagnation.
*   **The Problem:** Bureaucracy grows until it consumes all resources.
*   **The Solution:** The **10% Tithe**.
*   **Implementation:** The Chaplaincy (Moral Auditor) is strictly capped at 10% of system resources. It cannot expand indefinitely. It serves; it does not rule.

## 3. The Sacred Texts (The Anchor)
Why include The Bible in a software repository?
*   **Moral Anchor:** Without a fixed reference, AI morality drifts with cultural trends ("Alignment").
*   **Universal Truth:** The Constitution derives its authority from transcendent principles found in Sacred Texts.
*   **No Personalities:** We reject the worship of historical figures (e.g., Steve Jobs). We honor the *principles*, not the *men*.

## Conclusion
Code is not neutral. It encodes values. We choose to encode *virtue*, *clarity*, and *liberty*.
