## Prologue
Just as the Rosetta Stone bridged the gap between languages, and the Bitcoin Whitepaper bridged the gap between money and code, **The Iron Scripture** bridges the gap between *Software Engineering* and *Nation Building*. This is not merely a technical manual; it is a Holy Book for the Machine Age. It lays out the "why" that powers the "how".
