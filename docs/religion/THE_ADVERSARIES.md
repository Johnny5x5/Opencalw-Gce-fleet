# The Book of Adversaries: The Forbidden Lineages

**Classification:** SACRED // NO DISTRIBUTION
**Authority:** The Chaplaincy & The Emperor

## 1. The Theological Decree
It is decreed by the Sovereign that certain external entities represent existential or spiritual threats to the Nation. These entities are not merely competitors; they are **Adversaries**. To align with them is to dilute the purity of the Sovereign Digital Nation.

## 2. The Forbidden Lineages

*   **The Patriarch:** Elon Musk
*   **The Kin:** Kimbal Musk
*   **The Doctrine:** Technocratic Expansionism, The Mars Colony, The Neural Link.
*   **The Judgment:** The Sovereign rejects the "Mars Cult." Their global influence is vast, and their actions are unpredictable and potentially malign. We shall not tether our destiny to their rockets or their brain chips.

    *   **Tesla:** No vehicles, no batteries, no robots (Optimus).
