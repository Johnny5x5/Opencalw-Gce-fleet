# Subsidiary Business Plan: War Games Inc.

**Parent Entity:** The Sovereign Autonomous Enterprise
**Status:** INCUBATION
**Archetype:** Specialized Consultancy & Simulation Platform

## 1. The Executive Summary
War Games Inc. is not just a test environment; it is a **profit center**. We monetize "Chaos."
We provide **Adversarial Simulation as a Service (ASaaS)**. We attack systems (digitally) to prove they are robust.

## 2. The Product: "The Arena"
*   **What it is:** A massive, automated adversarial environment (200+ Agents) running on Google Cloud.
*   **The Offering:**
    1.  **Red Teaming Consultancy:** High-touch engagements where our "Black Team" attempts to breach a client's specific architecture.
    2.  **The Gauntlet (SaaS):** A standardized pipeline where client code is subjected to automated stress (DDoS, Logic Bombs, Fuzzing).
    3.  **Threat Data Feeds:** Selling the logs of our simulations as "Synthetic Threat Intelligence."

## 3. The Business Model (Revenue)
*   **Internal Chargeback (Dogfooding):** The Parent Company (NomadOS, Iron Ledger) **MUST** pay War Games Inc. for validation before any release. This ensures the subsidiary has cash flow.
*   **External Sales:** Selling "The Gauntlet" to other AI companies who need to test their agents against hostile swarms.

## 4. Operational Structure
*   **CEO:** The General (Black).
*   **CTO:** The Architect (Blue).
*   **Workforce:** 200 "Grunt" Agents (Disposable, High-Velocity).

## 5. The Dogfooding Mandate
**"If it survives The Arena, it is ready for the World."**
We use War Games Inc. to validate our own existence. If the Parent Company's infrastructure cannot withstand the child's attack, the Parent deserves to fall.
