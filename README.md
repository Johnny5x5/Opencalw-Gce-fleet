# Opencalw-Gce-fleet
Open claw on Google Cloud engine and this is going to be scalable to a fleet hours a five. This is a middle management AI layer We're going to try to make a corporate conglomerate ecosystem and a virtual office environment within this repo. We're going to also have a tool chain that a human would need and a AI would need to have a virtual office.


eventually if it works out we're looking to do a temporal AI long running task setup. furthermore we're going to be using a multi-agent system framework. another thing is that we're going to be believing in the world model for AIs. we're going to set up as much connectivity as possible to achieve the virtual conglomerate office.
we're going to try to keep within Google Cloud for the majority of the use cases and needs but I understand that there are certain items that are outside of Google Cloud that are more effective and better in the use case that they do so we're going to use those things that are better than what Google has. Open router, Claude whitelisted examples. 
We are going to blacklist anything that has to do with Elon musk and his businesses and his services and anything that is directly related to Elon musk from a business perspective is to not being integrated into this project and to other projects.
Elon musk is a competitor. so if I build my foundations and components and other things using his software I make him richer faster than I can buy them out.
