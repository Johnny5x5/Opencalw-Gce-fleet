# Pillar 13: The Linguistic Library (Meaning)

**Mission:** To anchor the meaning of words against cultural drift.

## Structure

*   **[Definitions](./definitions/) (The Dictionary):** Canonical definitions of key terms (e.g., "Reasonable Force," "Privacy," "Merchant") stamped with a specific time and context (e.g., v2024).

## Strategy

We use this library to prevent "Semantic Rot." A law written in 2024 using the word "Reasonable" links to the 2024 definition of "Reasonable" in this folder. This ensures that even if the language evolves, the **Original Intent** remains locked.
