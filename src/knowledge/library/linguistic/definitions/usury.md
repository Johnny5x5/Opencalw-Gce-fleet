# Definition: Usury

## Primary Meaning
**Usury** is the practice of charging interest on loans, specifically at rates that are exploitative or predatory. In the Sovereign Digital Nation, Usury is defined as any interest rate that traps the borrower in a cycle of debt or exceeds the "Fair Return" (e.g., > 5-10%).

## Historical Context
Biblically (Exodus 22:25), lending to the poor with interest was forbidden. In Medieval Europe, all interest was considered usury. Modern banking normalized it. The Sovereign Nation rejects this normalization.

## Usage in Law
*   **Corporate Code:** Corporations engaging in Usury lose their Tax Privilege (Covenant Violation).
*   **Banking Code:** Strictly caps interest rates on consumer loans.
