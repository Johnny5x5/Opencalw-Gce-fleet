# Definition: Jubilee

## Primary Meaning
The **Jubilee** is the foundational economic and legal principle of the Sovereign Digital Nation, mandating a periodic "Reset" of debts and servitude. Specifically, it enforces a **7-Year Hard Cap** on all negative conditions (Debt, Imprisonment, Contractual Servitude).

## Historical Context
Originating in Leviticus 25 and Deuteronomy 15, the Jubilee ensured that no Israelite could be permanently enslaved or impoverished. It prevented the accumulation of generational poverty.

## Usage in Law
*   **Penal Code Title 1:** Mandates release of prisoners after 7 years.
*   **Bankruptcy Law:** Discharges all debts after 7 years.
