# Pillar 1: The Legal Library (Governance)

**Mission:** To codify the Rules of Engagement for the Sovereign Digital Nation.

## Structure

*   **[Foreign](./foreign/) (The Mirror):** Contains exact copies of external laws (UCC, UNCLOS) for reference and compliance. **Read-Only.**
*   **[Sovereign](./sovereign/) (The Will):** Contains the Constitution, Decrees, and Overrides of the Nation. **Living Law.**

## Key Protocols

*   **Defense Level 2.5:** All laws are validated by the Rust Guardian against a strict schema.
*   **Jubilee Cap:** Maximum sentence is 7 years (unless Exile/Capital).
*   **Intent Preservation:** Sovereign laws must link to an `.intent.md` sidecar.
*   **Separation:** We mirror foreign law but do not mix it with our own.
