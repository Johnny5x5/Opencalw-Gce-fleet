# Title 1: The Sovereign Civic Infrastructure Act

## Section 101: The Primary Civic Forum (Administrative)
1.  **Establishment:** The State shall construct and maintain centralized physical locations known as **Primary Civic Forums** (The Government Malls).
2.  **Purpose:** These centers serve as the exclusive, neutral, and secure physical nexus for high-level, non-punitive civic duties, including:
    *   **Face-to-Face Restitution** (as mandated by the Judicial Code for civil reconciliation).
    *   **Restorative Arbitration** (Civil and Commercial dispute resolution).
    *   **Witness Recording** (Scribe/Notary verifications).
    *   **Secure Sovereign Key Deposits** (The Seed Box/Dead Man's Switch terminals).

## Section 102: The Secondary Governance Mall (The Justice Node)
1.  **Bifurcation of Justice:** The punitive and adversarial aspects of Law shall not pollute the daily administrative flow of the Primary Civic Forum.
2.  **The Location:** For every Primary Civic Forum, there must be a designated **Secondary Governance Mall** (The Justice Node) located exactly **3 to 6 miles away** from the Primary Forum, situated away from the commercial city center.
3.  **Purpose & Contents:** This Secondary Mall is dedicated exclusively to administrative justice and punitive law. It shall house:
    *   **The Sovereign Criminal Courts** (where Trial by Dice and formal sentencing occur).
    *   **Pre-Trial Holding Jails** (for those awaiting trial).
    *   **The Legal District:** Zones specifically zoned for legal representation, allowing citizens to "shop" for Sovereign Attorneys and legal counsel in a centralized location.

## Section 103: The Anti-Sprawl Mandate (The 1-Mile Rule)
1.  **The Physical Constraint:** To prevent the cancerous sprawl of bureaucracy and the creation of unchecked "government cities," the total physical footprint of any single Sovereign Civic Center is strictly and legally capped at a maximum of **One (1) Square Mile**.
2.  **High-Density Efficiency:** The architecture of the Civic Center must utilize vertical building and hyper-efficient spatial design (akin to a mega-mall) to service the maximum number of citizens within this constrained perimeter. The State must build *up* and *efficiently*, not out.
3.  **Prohibition on Annexation:** The Government may not slowly annex surrounding land to expand the 1-Square Mile limit. If a region outgrows a Civic Center, a new, separate Center must be built elsewhere, subject to the same constraint.

## Section 104: The Geographic Distribution Mandate
1.  **Separation of Concerns (Physical Jurisdictions):** The Sovereign Digital Nation strictly forbids the clustering of different governmental levels within a single Civic Center. There must be absolute physical separation between:
    *   **City/Local Governance Malls**
    *   **State/Provincial Governance Malls**
    *   **National Governance Malls**
    *   **International/Diplomatic Malls**
2.  **The 20-Mile Grid:** To ensure equitable access for all citizens, State/Provincial level Civic Centers must be geographically distributed so that a citizen is generally no further than **20 Miles** from the nearest node.
3.  **Off-Centered Placement:** Civic Centers are legally prohibited from being constructed in the exact geographical or commercial center of a city. They must be "off-centered" to prevent bureaucratic operations from choking local commercial and residential traffic, while remaining highly accessible.
4.  **The Penal Exclusion:** Sovereign Prisons (long-term sentencing), Detention Centers, and Penal Labor Blocks are strictly excluded from the 1-Square Mile footprints of both the Primary Forum and the Secondary Justice Node. They must be constructed in separate, remote security zones.

## Section 105: Security and Neutrality
1.  **The City of Refuge:** Both the Primary and Secondary Malls are designated zones of absolute neutrality. They are sanctioned arenas for resolving conflict without vigilante violence.
2.  **Guarded Perimeter:** The Centers shall be heavily fortified and guarded by the **Sovereign Defense Force** (The Militia).
3.  **Weaponry Prohibition:** No citizen or foreign entity may carry weapons within the perimeter of the Civic Centers, excepting on-duty Sovereign Guards. Violence within these zones is classified as High Treason against the Peace.

## Section 106: The Sovereign Corridor and the 6-Block Setback
1.  **The Inter-Node Highway:** The State shall construct and maintain dedicated, high-speed physical roadways connecting all Primary Civic Forums and Secondary Governance Malls, known collectively as **The Sovereign Corridor**.
2.  **The Anti-Chokepoint Mandate:** Government infrastructure must never become a localized traffic bottleneck that strangles commercial or residential movement. Therefore, the Sovereign Corridor must be engineered for uninterrupted flow.
3.  **The 6-Block Setback Rule:** To enforce physical security (standoff distance) and strictly manage traffic density, no Sovereign Civic Center (Primary or Secondary) may be built directly abutting the Sovereign Corridor.
    *   **The Offset:** Every Government Mall must be physically offset by exactly **Six (6) City Blocks** from the main artery of the Sovereign Corridor.
    *   **Access Roads:** The State shall construct dedicated, controlled-access offshoots from the Corridor traversing these six blocks to service the Civic Centers, ensuring that high-volume government traffic is siphoned off the main highway long before it reaches the structures.

## Section 107: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
