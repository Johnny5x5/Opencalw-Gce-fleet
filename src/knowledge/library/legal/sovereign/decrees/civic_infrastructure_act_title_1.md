# Title 1: The Sovereign Civic Infrastructure Act

## Section 101: The Sovereign Civic Center (The Forum)
1.  **Establishment:** The State shall construct and maintain centralized physical locations known as **Sovereign Civic Centers** (The Forums).
2.  **Purpose:** These centers serve as the exclusive, neutral, and secure physical nexus for high-level civic duties, including:
    *   **Face-to-Face Restitution** (as mandated by the Judicial Code).
    *   **Restorative Arbitration** and Judicial hearings.
    *   **Witness Recording** (Scribe/Notary verifications).
    *   **Secure Sovereign Key Deposits** (The Seed Box/Dead Man's Switch terminals).

## Section 102: The Anti-Sprawl Mandate (The 1-Mile Rule)
1.  **The Physical Constraint:** To prevent the cancerous sprawl of bureaucracy and the creation of unchecked "government cities," the total physical footprint of any single Sovereign Civic Center is strictly and legally capped at a maximum of **One (1) Square Mile**.
2.  **High-Density Efficiency:** The architecture of the Civic Center must utilize vertical building and hyper-efficient spatial design (akin to a mega-mall) to service the maximum number of citizens within this constrained perimeter. The State must build *up* and *efficiently*, not out.
3.  **Prohibition on Annexation:** The Government may not slowly annex surrounding land to expand the 1-Square Mile limit. If a region outgrows a Civic Center, a new, separate Center must be built elsewhere, subject to the same constraint.

## Section 103: The Geographic Distribution Mandate
1.  **Separation of Concerns (Physical Jurisdictions):** The Sovereign Digital Nation strictly forbids the clustering of different governmental levels within a single Civic Center. There must be absolute physical separation between:
    *   **City/Local Governance Malls**
    *   **State/Provincial Governance Malls**
    *   **National Governance Malls**
    *   **International/Diplomatic Malls**
2.  **The 20-Mile Grid:** To ensure equitable access for all citizens, State/Provincial level Civic Centers must be geographically distributed so that a citizen is generally no further than **20 Miles** from the nearest node.
3.  **Off-Centered Placement:** Civic Centers are legally prohibited from being constructed in the exact geographical or commercial center of a city. They must be "off-centered" to prevent bureaucratic operations from choking local commercial and residential traffic, while remaining highly accessible.
4.  **The Penal Exclusion:** Sovereign Prisons, Detention Centers, and Penal Labor Blocks are strictly excluded from the 1-Square Mile Civic Center footprint. They must be constructed in separate, designated security zones.

## Section 104: Security and Neutrality
1.  **The City of Refuge:** The Civic Center is a designated zone of absolute neutrality. It is the sanctioned arena for resolving conflict without violence.
2.  **Guarded Perimeter:** The Center shall be heavily fortified and guarded by the **Sovereign Defense Force** (The Militia).
3.  **Weaponry Prohibition:** No citizen or foreign entity may carry weapons within the perimeter of the Civic Center, excepting on-duty Sovereign Guards. Violence within the Forum is classified as High Treason against the Peace.

## Section 105: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
