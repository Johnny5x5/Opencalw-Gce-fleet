# Title 1: The Sovereign Judicial Code

## Section 101: The Trial of Providence (The Dice Protocol)
1.  **Scope:** This specific trial method is reserved for cases of **Negligent Harm** (e.g., Food Poisoning, Industrial Accidents) where the determination of "Divine Will" vs. "Human Error" is contested, or to determine if the Offender must suffer the *exact* fate of the Victim (Lex Talionis).
2.  **The Artifacts (The Four Dice):**
    *   **Ownership:** The Four Dice are the exclusive property of the Sovereign Digital Nation and shall be guarded as High State Secrets.
    *   **Composition:**
        *   **Three (3) State Dice:** Provided by the Sovereign Judiciary.
        *   **One (1) Religious Die:** Provided by the High Priest or Representative of the Faith relevant to the trial (Christianity or Judaism).
3.  **The Ritual:**
    *   **Presence:** The dice are cast before the Judge, the Accused, the Victim, and God.
    *   **The Cast:** The Accused casts the dice.
    *   **Interpretation:** The outcome determines the severity of the **Retributive Punishment** (e.g., whether the offender must consume the same spoiled food, or serve the same sentence).
    *   **Objective:** To allow Providence a vote in the outcome of Justice.

## Section 102: The Standard of Evidence
1.  **Zero Ambiguity:** No citizen shall be convicted on "Probable Cause" alone. The standard is **Certainty**.
2.  **Two Witnesses:** As per Biblical Law (Deuteronomy 19:15), no man shall be condemned by the mouth of a single witness. There must be two witnesses or irrefutable digital evidence (The Sovereign Ledger).

## Section 103: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
