# Intent: The Sovereign Education Act

## 1. The Goal: A Nation of Polymaths
The survival of the Sovereign Digital Nation depends on the intellectual superiority of its citizenry. We do not produce workers; we produce **Architects, Defenders, and Creators**.

## 2. The Standard (14th Grade +)
A standard K-12 education is insufficient for the modern world.
*   **The Baseline:** Every citizen must complete K-12 plus a minimum of 2 years of higher education (14th Grade).
*   **The Scope:** Education is not just STEM; it is the mastery of Language, Law, and Art.

## 3. The Pillars of the Curriculum
*   **Communication (Polyglot):** To lead, one must communicate. **ASL** connects us to the non-verbal; **Latin** connects us to the roots of Western civilization and Law.
*   **Defense (Legal):** The courtroom is a battlefield. Every citizen must be a **Sovereign Attorney**, capable of defending their rights against any adversary.
*   **Expression (Music):** A mind that can master the **Piano, Guitar, and Trumpet** is a mind that understands discipline, harmony, and mathematics in motion.
*   **Knowledge (Polymath):** Mastery of History, Civics, and STEM ensures a well-rounded leader.
*   **Stewardship (Animal Husbandry):** A Sovereign Citizen must command nature, not just code. Mastery of dogs, horses, and livestock connects us to the living earth.

## 4. Field Work (The Mud)
Education does not happen only in classrooms. It happens in the mud, on the farms, working with living beasts of burden. Every citizen must know how to work the land and lead the pack.

## 5. State Funding
This is not a private burden. The State invests in this education because the State is the beneficiary of the resulting Genius.
