# Intent: The Sovereign Education Act

## 1. The Goal: A Nation of Polymaths
The survival of the Sovereign Digital Nation depends on the intellectual superiority of its citizenry. We do not produce workers; we produce **Architects, Defenders, and Creators**.

## 2. The Standard (14th Grade +)
A standard K-12 education is insufficient for the modern world.
*   **The Baseline:** Every citizen must complete K-12 plus a minimum of 2 years of higher education (14th Grade).
*   **The Scope:** Education is not just STEM; it is the mastery of Language, Law, and Art.

## 3. The Pillars of the Curriculum
*   **Communication (Polyglot):** To lead, one must communicate. **ASL** connects us to the non-verbal; **Latin** connects us to the roots of Western civilization and Law.
*   **Defense (Legal):** The courtroom is a battlefield. Every citizen must be a **Sovereign Attorney**, capable of defending their rights against any adversary.
*   **Expression (Music):** A mind that can master the **Piano, Guitar, and Trumpet** is a mind that understands discipline, harmony, and mathematics in motion.
*   **Knowledge (Polymath):** Mastery of History, Civics, and STEM ensures a well-rounded leader.

## 4. State Funding
This is not a private burden. The State invests in this education because the State is the beneficiary of the resulting Genius.
