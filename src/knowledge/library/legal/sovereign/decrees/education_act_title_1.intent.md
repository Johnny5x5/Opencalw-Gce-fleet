# Intent: The Sovereign Education Act

## 1. The Core Philosophy
Modern education often produces highly credentialed but practically useless citizens. The Sovereign Digital Nation rejects the "perpetual childhood" model of the West. Education must be a forge that produces self-reliant, morally grounded, and practically skilled men and women.

## 2. The 16-Year Mandate (The Baseline)
A basic high school diploma is insufficient for the Sovereign Citizen. We require a mandatory, state-funded 16-year education (Kindergarten through an Associate's Degree / 14th Grade equivalent) as the absolute baseline for all citizens.
*   **Universal Application:** This applies to all youth coming of age, and retroactively to adult citizens who must achieve this standard.
*   **The Goal:** A populace that is universally literate, mathematically competent, scientifically grounded (STEM), and fluent in multiple languages.

## 3. The End of the "Experience Gap"
We reject the modern tragedy of young adults entering the workforce with zero practical experience, morale, or work ethic.
*   **Integrated Labor:** Job training begins in Kindergarten. From age 5 to 21, every citizen will hold age-appropriate, part-time jobs integrated directly into their schooling. They will learn the value of labor, the sting of a hard day's work, and the satisfaction of earning their keep long before they graduate.

## 4. The Survival Mandate & The Festival of Booths (Sukkot)
A Sovereign Citizen must be hard to kill. The Nation must be resilient against disaster, whether domestic or external.
*   **Compulsory Hardness:** First Aid, Self-Defense, and Wilderness Survival are not electives; they are core curriculum. A citizen who cannot defend themselves or bandage a wound is a liability to the Nation.
*   **Annual Recertification:** Skills perish without practice. Therefore, survival and self-defense skills must be recertified every single year.
*   **The Sukkot Adoption:** We adopt the Jewish Biblical tradition of *Sukkot* (The Festival of Booths) as a mandatory national survival exercise. For one week every year, the Nation halts normal commercial labor. Citizens must leave their comfortable homes, build temporary shelters (tents/booths), and live in the elements. This is not just a religious homage; it is a forced, annual stress-test of the Nation's emergency readiness and self-reliance.
