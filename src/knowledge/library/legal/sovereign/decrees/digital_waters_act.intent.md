# Intent: The Digital Waters Act

## 1. The Problem
International Maritime Law (UNCLOS) is often applied to the Internet ("The High Seas"), allowing foreign surveillance under the guise of "Freedom of Navigation."

## 2. The Goal
We assert that **Digital Space is Sovereign Territory.**
*   We reject the idea that our network is a "Public Common" for foreign spies.
*   We establish Privacy as a Property Right, not just a civil liberty.

## 3. The Limitation
This applies to **Commercial and State Surveillance**. It does not apply to legitimate, open communication protocols (e.g., standard HTTP requests) unless they are used for mapping/exploitation.
