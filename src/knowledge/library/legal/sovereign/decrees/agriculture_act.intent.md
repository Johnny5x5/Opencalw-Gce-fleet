# Intent: The Sovereign Agriculture & Land Rest Act

## 1. The Problem
Modern industrial agriculture depletes soil nutrients, relies heavily on chemical inputs, and degrades the long-term fertility of the land. Continuous cultivation without rest leads to desertification and ecological collapse.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Land Stewardship System** based on Biblical principles of rest (Sabbatical Year) and restoration:
*   **Sabbatical Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory cessation of all commercial sowing, reaping, and pruning every 7th year to allow the land to lie fallow and regenerate its nutrients naturally.
*   **Grand Jubilee Rest (50th Year):** A complete commercial moratorium every 50th year, ensuring generational land fertility.
*   **Personal Provision:** The "gleaning" of what grows naturally during rest years is permitted for personal sustenance, recognizing the right to feed oneself from the volunteer crop.

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Commercial Ban:** Strict prohibition on planting, harvesting for profit, or processing crops during Jubilee years.
*   **Soil Regeneration:** The moratorium is designated for soil health recovery, allowing cover crops and natural vegetation to restore nitrogen and organic matter.
