# Intent: The Sovereign Commercial Code

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Two Worlds, Two Laws
We recognize that the world outside our borders operates on different principles than the world inside.
*   **Domestic (The Family):** Inside, we are a Family. We treat each other with grace, fairness, and a presumption of goodwill. Disputes are solved with Restorative Arbitration.
*   **Foreign (The Merchant):** Outside, it is a jungle. We treat strangers with caution, strict contracts, and verified bonds.

## 2. Adoption of the UCC
We do not reinvent the wheel for international trade.
*   **Compatibility:** By adopting the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** for foreign commerce, we ensure our businesses can trade globally without friction.
*   **Containment:** However, we strictly contain the UCC to the "Foreign Jurisdiction." We do not let its adversarial, low-trust nature infect our Domestic "Family" commerce.

## 3. The Anti-Extortion Mandate (Price Gouging)
*   **Profit vs. Extortion:** We celebrate the builder who makes a profit. We punish the parasite who exploits a crisis.
*   **The American Hybrid:** We adopt the American state-level standard (strict 15% cap during emergencies for essential goods), but we elevate it with the Sovereign standard: ongoing algorithmic monitoring by the Witness Branch to prevent cartel behavior even in peacetime.
