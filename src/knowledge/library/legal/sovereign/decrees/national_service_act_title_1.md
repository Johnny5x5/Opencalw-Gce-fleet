# Title 1: The National Service & Development Act

## Section 101: The Sovereign Contract (The Lifecycle)
1.  **Scope:** Every citizen is bound by a Government Contract from **Age -5 (Pre-Conception)** to **Age 30**.
2.  **Definition:** During this period, the Citizen is a ward and student of the State, dedicated to the optimization of their Body, Mind, and Soul.
3.  **Funding:** The State creates a "Sovereign Trust" for each citizen to fund this massive investment in Human Capital.

## Section 102: The Pre-Natal Mandate (Age -5 to 0)
1.  **Optimization:** The State shall provide comprehensive genetic screening, nutritional support, and biological optimization for all prospective parents starting **5 years prior to conception**.
2.  **Goal:** To ensure every child is born with the highest possible genetic and biological potential.
3.  **Prohibition:** No conception shall occur without the completion of the Pre-Natal Protocol.

## Section 103: The Childbearing Restriction
1.  **Minimum Age:** No citizen shall bear or father a child before the age of **27** (Standard) or **30** (Optimized).
2.  **Reasoning:**
    *   **Educational Load:** The Compulsory Education (14th Grade, Law, Music, Military) requires total focus.
    *   **Maturity:** Parenthood requires a completed Sovereign Citizen (Polymath).
3.  **Waiver:** Exceptions are granted only by the **High Council** for specific strategic needs.

## Section 104: The Post-Service Reward (Age 35+)
1.  **Completion:** Upon reaching Age 35 and having fulfilled all Educational, Military, and Service obligations, the Citizen is granted **Full Sovereign Status**.
2.  **Family Support:** The State shall "pour on benefits" to the family unit, including:
    *   Housing Grants.
    *   Childcare Support.
    *   Advanced Resource Allocation.

## Section 105: Suspension of Consequences
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for violation of this Act are currently **Suspended**.
*   **Note:** This suspension does not negate the Contract, but pauses the enforcement of penalties.
