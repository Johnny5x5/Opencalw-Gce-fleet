4.  **Waiver:** Exceptions are granted only by the **High Council** for specific strategic needs.

## Section 104: The Post-Service Reward (The Second Half of Life)
1.  **The Reciprocal Contract:** Because the Citizen has dedicated the first half of their life (Age -5 to 30) to the needs of the Nation, the Nation shall dedicate itself to the needs of the Citizen for the second half of their life.

## Section 106: Suspension of Consequences
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for violation of this Act are currently **Suspended**.
*   **Note:** This suspension does not negate the Contract, but pauses the enforcement of penalties.
