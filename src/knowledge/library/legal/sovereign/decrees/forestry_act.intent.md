# Intent: The Sovereign Forestry & Timber Stewardship Act

## 1. The Problem
Commercial deforestation threatens the biodiversity, climate stability, and soil integrity of the Sovereign Digital Nation. Unrestricted logging without periods of rest leads to deforestation and loss of habitat.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Forest Management System** based on Biblical principles of rest and stewardship:
*   **Jubilee Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory cessation of all commercial logging every 7th year allows the forest ecosystem to regenerate and wildlife to thrive undisturbed.
*   **Grand Jubilee Rest (50th Year):** A complete commercial moratorium every 50th year, ensuring the preservation of old-growth potential.
*   **Personal Use:** Personal gathering of deadwood or fallen timber for fuel or construction is permitted, but live tree harvesting is restricted during rest years.

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Commercial Ban:** Strict prohibition on industrial-scale logging during Jubilee years.
*   **Generational Growth:** The moratorium is designated to allow younger trees to mature and the forest floor to recover from machinery impact.
