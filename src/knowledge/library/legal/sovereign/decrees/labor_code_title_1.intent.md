# Intent: The Sovereign Labor & Guild Act

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Work is Worship
In the Sovereign Digital Nation, labor is not a transaction; it is a **Sacred Duty**.
*   **Dignity:** Every citizen has the right to contribute. Idleness is spiritual death.
*   **Rest:** The Sabbath is not a break; it is a **recalibration**. Without rest, work becomes slavery.

## 2. Stability over Speed (The Anti-Gig Protocol)
We reject the "Gig Economy" that treats humans as disposable algorithms.
*   **Guilds:** We return to the ancient wisdom of the **Guild System**. Apprentices become Masters. Careers are built over decades, not days.
*   **10-Generation Link:** A stable job means a stable family, which means a stable nation.

## 3. The Jubilee (Freedom from Bondage)
No contract is forever.
*   **The 7-Year Limit:** Every 7 years, the worker is free. This prevents "Wage Slavery" and ensures that labor agreements remain fair and consensual.
*   **Non-Compete Ban:** Knowledge belongs to the worker. A company cannot own a man's future.
