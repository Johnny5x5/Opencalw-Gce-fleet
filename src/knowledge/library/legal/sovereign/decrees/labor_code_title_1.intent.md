# Intent: The Sovereign Labor & Guild Act

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Work is Worship
In the Sovereign Digital Nation, labor is not a transaction; it is a **Sacred Duty**.
*   **Dignity:** Every citizen has the right to contribute. Idleness is spiritual death.
*   **Rest:** The Sabbath is not a break; it is a **recalibration**. Without rest, work becomes slavery.

## 2. The Body is a Temple (Biological Rights)
We must never forget that the worker is a biological being, created in the image of God, not a machine.
*   **Common Sense:** To deny water or the bathroom is not "management"; it is **abuse**.
*   **Explicit Rights:** We codify these basic biological needs (Water, 4-Hour Bathroom Rule, Food) to prevent the "dips and valleys" of morality that occur in history. What is obvious today must remain Law tomorrow.

## 3. Faith without Works is Dead (The Balance)
We are a nation of believers, but we are also a nation of builders.
*   **Prayer:** We protect the right to pray, recognizing it as essential fuel for the soul.
*   **Duty:** We reject the use of religion as an excuse for sloth. Prayer must be efficient (5 times daily max). True holiness is found in doing one's duty with excellence.

## 4. Stability over Speed (The Anti-Gig Protocol)
We reject the "Gig Economy" that treats humans as disposable algorithms.
*   **Guilds:** We return to the ancient wisdom of the **Guild System**. Apprentices become Masters. Careers are built over decades, not days.
*   **10-Generation Link:** A stable job means a stable family, which means a stable nation.

## 5. The Jubilee (Freedom from Bondage)
No contract is forever.
*   **The 7-Year Limit:** Every 7 years, the worker is free. This prevents "Wage Slavery" and ensures that labor agreements remain fair and consensual.
*   **Non-Compete Ban:** Knowledge belongs to the worker. A company cannot own a man's future.
