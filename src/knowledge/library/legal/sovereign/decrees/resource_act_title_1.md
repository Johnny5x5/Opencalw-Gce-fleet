# Title 1: The Sovereign Resource & Land Act

## Section 101: The Philosophy of Stewardship
1.  **The Tenancy Principle:** The land, the water, and the elements contained within the Sovereign Digital Nation's physical territory ultimately belong to the Creator. The State and the Citizenry act merely as stewards and tenants. "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine" (Leviticus 25:23).
2.  **Anti-Exhaustion:** It is a violation of the Sovereign Contract to extract from the earth to the point of permanent exhaustion. The 10-Generation Horizon applies equally to the soil as it does to the economy.

## Section 102: The Sabbath of the Land (The 7-Year Jubilee)
1.  **The Mandate of Rest:** Every seventh (7th) consecutive year is legally declared a **Sabbath of the Land**.
2.  **Commercial Cessation:** During this year, all large-scale, commercial exploitation of natural plant-based and mineral resources must cease entirely. This includes:
    *   **Agriculture:** No commercial planting, tilling, or mechanized harvesting of crops.
    *   **Forestry:** No commercial logging or timber extraction.
    *   **Mining:** All active extraction of minerals, metals, and fossil fuels must halt.
    *   **Fishing:** Commercial trawling, netting, and mass harvesting of wild aquatic life are prohibited.
3.  **The Sustenance Exception (The Gleaning Right):**
    *   Citizens retain the absolute right to enter fallow lands, forests, and waters to gather, forage, and hunt for the **direct sustenance** of their own Household.
    *   **Prohibition on Trade:** Resources gathered under the Sustenance Exception may be consumed or given freely, but they may *not* be sold into the commercial market for profit.

## Section 103: The Livestock Bridge (The Jubilee Ramp-Up)
1.  **The Exemption:** Animal Husbandry—specifically the raising, breeding, and processing of cattle, herd animals, and farm animals—is explicitly **exempt** from the commercial cessation of the 7-Year Jubilee.
2.  **The Strategic Ramp-Up:** To ensure the nutritional security and economic stability of the Nation during the Sabbath of the Land, the State and Sovereign Corporations are mandated to strategically **ramp up livestock production** in the years immediately preceding and during the Jubilee.
3.  **Grazing Synergy (Years 6 through 9):** To maximize natural fertilization and soil restoration, structured herd rotation upon fallow and recovering agricultural lands shall commence in the **6th Year**, continue through the **7th Year (Jubilee)**, and extend into the **8th and 9th Years** to support the initial post-Jubilee recovery harvests.
4.  **Caloric Bridge:** The increased yield of meat, dairy, and animal byproducts shall act as the "Caloric Bridge" to replace the commercial shortfall of plant-based agriculture during the rest year.
5.  **The Firstborn Mandate (Genetic Preservation):** In accordance with Biblical instruction, the eldest/firstborn male of each cattle, herd, and farm animal type must be legally preserved. They may not be slaughtered for commercial meat.
    *   **Purpose:** This acts as the Nation's biological "seed vault," ensuring the capacity to accurately trace bloodlines, preserve genetic resilience against geological or biological shifts, and fulfill the Biblical requirement of dedicating the firstborn.

## Section 104: The Grand Jubilee (The 50-Year Reset)
1.  **The Event:** Following seven cycles of seven years, the fiftieth (50th) year is declared the **Grand Jubilee**.
2.  **Land Reversion:** To prevent the formation of eternal, monopolistic mega-estates that inevitably lead to feudalism, all commercial leases of Sovereign-held lands revert back to the **State Trust** for redistribution or rest.
3.  **Debt Forgiveness:** All debts secured against physical land are formally canceled in the 50th year.

## Section 105: The Lifeblood Mandate (Water and Energy)
1.  **Water as a Right:** Access to clean, unpolluted water is a fundamental human right.
    *   No corporation may claim exclusive ownership over a natural aquifer or river to the exclusion of the citizenry.
    *   The commodification of water for exorbitant profit is classified as Extortion.
2.  **The Energy Throttling Protocol:**
    *   During the 7-Year Jubilee, commercial power generation grids are mandated to throttle down to **"Base Load Sustenance Levels."**
    *   This forces a mandatory period of systemic maintenance, grid repair, and ecological cooling, preventing the infrastructure from running at maximum degradation until failure.

## Section 106: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
