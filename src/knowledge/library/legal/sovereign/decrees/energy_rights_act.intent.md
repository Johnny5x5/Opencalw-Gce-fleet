# Intent: The Sovereign Energy Rights & Stewardship Act

## 1. The Problem
Energy independence is crucial for sovereignty. Relying on external, centralized, and non-renewable energy sources creates dependency and vulnerability. The exploitation of energy resources often harms the environment and concentrates power in the hands of a few.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Energy Rights System** based on Biblical principles of stewardship and freedom:
*   **Energy Sovereignty:** Every citizen has the right to generate, store, and consume their own energy (Solar, Wind, Geothermal).
*   **Jubilee Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory audit and maintenance period for commercial energy production, prioritizing efficiency and grid resilience.
*   **Grand Jubilee Reset (50th Year):** A complete review of energy infrastructure, ensuring that legacy systems are retired and replaced with sustainable alternatives.
*   **No Tax on Sunlight:** The sun, wind, and geothermal heat are gifts from God. No tax shall be levied on their capture.

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Right to Generate:** Absolute freedom for individuals to install solar panels, wind turbines, etc.
*   **Grid Independence:** The right to disconnect from the grid is guaranteed.
*   **Jubilee Audit:** Commercial providers must dedicate Jubilee years to upgrading efficiency and reducing waste, rather than maximizing output.
