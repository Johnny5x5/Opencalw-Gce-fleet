# Title 1: The Sovereign Labor & Guild Act

## Section 101: The Dignity of Labor
1.  **Work as Worship:** In the Sovereign Digital Nation, work is not a curse but a divine duty. Every citizen has a right and a responsibility to contribute their talents to the Nation.
2.  **Anti-Idleness:** Voluntary unemployment while able-bodied is a violation of the Sovereign Contract (Age -5 to 30) and grounds for the suspension of benefits.

## Section 102: The Sabbath Mandate (Rest)
1.  **Universal Rest:** No commercial labor shall be performed on the **Seventh Day**.
2.  **Scope:** This applies to all Citizens, Non-Citizen Residents, and Automated Systems requiring human oversight.
3.  **Penalty:** Violation is "Wage Theft against the Soul" and incurs a double-wage penalty paid to the worker.

## Section 103: The Fair Wage Standard (Solvency)
1.  **Definition:** A "Fair Wage" is defined not by market minimums, but by **Household Solvency**.
2.  **Calculation:** A Fair Wage must be sufficient to:
    *   Cover the **10% Household Tax**.
    *   Cover the **Sovereign Trust Contribution**.
    *   Provide sustenance for a family of four.
3.  **Prohibition on Usury (Wage Theft):** The withholding of wages for even **one day** past the agreed payment date is a crime of Usury. Wages must be paid promptly (Deuteronomy 24:15).

## Section 104: The Guild System (Anti-Gig)
1.  **Preference for Stability:** The State explicitly favors long-term **Guild Employment** (Apprenticeship -> Journeyman -> Master) over short-term "Gig" contracts.
2.  **The 10-Generation Link:** Corporations that offer "Lifetime Employment Tracks" receive preferential tax treatment (The Loyalty Discount).
3.  **Gig Tax:** Companies relying primarily on transient, gig-based labor shall be subject to a **Instability Surcharge** to fund the social safety net their model erodes.

## Section 105: The Jubilee Protocol (Labor Freedom)
1.  **Contractual Reset:** All employment contracts, non-compete clauses, and labor debts expire automatically every **Seven (7) Years** (The Jubilee).
2.  **Prohibition on Bondage:** No contract may bind a worker for longer than 7 years.
3.  **Freedom of Movement:** At the Jubilee, the worker is free to renegotiate, leave, or change Guilds without penalty.

## Section 106: The Religious Balance (Prayer Mandate)
1.  **Right to Prayer:** All employees of Government, Corporate, and Non-Profit entities are guaranteed the right to pause for prayer during working hours.
2.  **The Limit:** This right is capped at **Five (5) Times per Day**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Excessive piety at the expense of duty is not holiness; it is sloth (violation of Section 101).
    *   **Exemption:** This limit does not apply to employees whose specific job description is religious in nature (Chaplain, Pastor, Imam, etc.).
3.  **Accommodation:** Employers must provide a quiet, respectful space for this observance.
4.  **Disruption:** Prayer must be efficient and non-disruptive. Using prayer as a pretext for "Time Theft" is a punishable offense.

## Section 107: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
