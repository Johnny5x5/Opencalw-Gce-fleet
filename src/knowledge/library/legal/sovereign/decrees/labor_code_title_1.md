# Title 1: The Sovereign Labor & Guild Act

## Section 101: The Dignity of Labor
1.  **Work as Worship:** In the Sovereign Digital Nation, work is not a curse but a divine duty. Every citizen has a right and a responsibility to contribute their talents to the Nation.
2.  **Anti-Idleness:** Voluntary unemployment while able-bodied is a violation of the Sovereign Contract (Age -5 to 30) and grounds for the suspension of benefits.

## Section 102: The Sabbath Mandate (Rest)
1.  **Universal Rest:** No commercial labor shall be performed on the **Seventh Day**.
2.  **Scope:** This applies to all Citizens, Non-Citizen Residents, and Automated Systems requiring human oversight.
3.  **Penalty:** Violation is "Wage Theft against the Soul" and incurs a double-wage penalty paid to the worker.

## Section 103: The Fair Wage Standard (Solvency)
1.  **Definition:** A "Fair Wage" is defined not by market minimums, but by **Household Solvency**.
2.  **Calculation:** A Fair Wage must be sufficient to:
    *   Cover the **10% Household Tax**.
    *   Cover the **Sovereign Trust Contribution**.
    *   Provide sustenance for a family of four.
3.  **Prohibition on Usury (Wage Theft):** The withholding of wages for even **one day** past the agreed payment date is a crime of Usury. Wages must be paid promptly (Deuteronomy 24:15).

## Section 104: The Guild System (Anti-Gig)
1.  **Preference for Stability:** The State explicitly favors long-term **Guild Employment** (Apprenticeship -> Journeyman -> Master) over short-term "Gig" contracts.
2.  **The 10-Generation Link:** Corporations that offer "Lifetime Employment Tracks" receive preferential tax treatment (The Loyalty Discount).
3.  **Gig Tax:** Companies relying primarily on transient, gig-based labor shall be subject to a **Instability Surcharge** to fund the social safety net their model erodes.

## Section 105: The Jubilee Protocol (Labor Freedom)
1.  **Contractual Reset:** All employment contracts, non-compete clauses, and labor debts expire automatically every **Seven (7) Years** (The Jubilee).
2.  **Prohibition on Bondage:** No contract may bind a worker for longer than 7 years.
3.  **Freedom of Movement:** At the Jubilee, the worker is free to renegotiate, leave, or change Guilds without penalty.

## Section 106: The Religious Balance (Prayer Mandate)
1.  **Right to Prayer:** All employees of Government, Corporate, Non-Profit, **Legal**, and **Judicial** entities are guaranteed the right to pause for prayer during working hours.
2.  **Scope:** This mandate explicitly includes all **Law Enforcement Officers**, **Attorneys**, **Judges**, and **Bureaucrats**.
3.  **The Limit:** This right is capped at **Five (5) Times per Day**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Excessive piety at the expense of duty is not holiness; it is sloth (violation of Section 101).
    *   **Exemption:** This limit does not apply to employees whose specific job description is explicitly religious in nature (Chaplain, Pastor, Imam, etc.).
4.  **Accommodation:** Employers must provide a quiet, respectful space for this observance.
5.  **Disruption:** Prayer must be efficient and non-disruptive. Using prayer as a pretext for "Time Theft" is a punishable offense.

## Section 107: The Worker's Bill of Rights (Biological Mandate)
1.  **The Hydration Mandate:**
    *   **Right:** Every worker has the absolute right to clean, drinkable water at all times.
    *   **Violation:** Denial of water is classified as "Biological Abuse" and is a punishable offense.
2.  **The Biological Necessity Mandate (The 4-Hour Rule):**
    *   **Right:** Every worker is guaranteed a bathroom break at least every **Four (4) Hours**.
    *   **Prohibition:** It is illegal to force a worker to "hold it" beyond this limit.
    *   **Health Liability:** Any sickness or medical condition (short or long term) resulting from the denial of this right (e.g., kidney issues, infections) is the **Strict Liability** of the Employer. The Employer must pay **100% of all medical bills** plus punitive damages.
    *   **Corporal Penalty:** Any staff member in the hierarchy (Manager, Director, Executive) who enforces a policy infringing on this right shall receive **Two (2) Canes per Offense**.
3.  **The Sustenance Mandate (The Quad-Break Standard):**
    *   **Scientific Basis:** Recognizing modern metabolic science, the State mandates a feeding schedule that optimizes health and prevents fatigue.
    *   **The Four Intervals:** Every worker is guaranteed **Four (4) Sustenance Breaks** per standard active cycle (shift).
        *   **1. Sunup (Breakfast):** The foundation of the day.
        *   **2. High Noon (Lunch):** A mandatory **1-Hour Break**.
        *   **3. Afternoon (Tea/Snack):** A recalibration break.
        *   **4. Sundown (Dinner):** The closing meal.
    *   **Field Measurement:** For workers without clocks, the **High Noon** break is determined by the sun's position. A "1-Hour Break" is approximately **Two (2) Hand-Widths** of solar movement (Primitive Tracking Standard).
    *   **Enforcement:** Employers must schedule these intervals. Failure to provide time to eat is "Biological Theft."

## Section 108: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
