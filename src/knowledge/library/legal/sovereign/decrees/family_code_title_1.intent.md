# Intent: The Sovereign Family Code

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Strong Families build Strong Nations
The basic unit of society is not the individual, but the **Family**.
*   **Marriage:** This is a serious contract, not a fleeting emotion. It is a commitment to build a **Household** and a **Lineage** that will last for 10 generations.
*   **Parenting:** Raising a child is the most important job in the world. We demand that parents be **trained, mature, and solvent** before they undertake it (Age 27/30).

## 2. Zero Ambiguity in Love and War
Conflict is inevitable, but chaos is not.
*   **Divorce:** We treat divorce as a **business dissolution**. Emotions are removed; contracts are honored.
*   **Custody:** The child is not a pawn. They have a right to both parents. The State will not facilitate parental alienation.

## 3. The Family Council
The State should be the last resort for family disputes.
*   **Self-Governance:** Families should solve their own problems. The **Family Council** (grandparents/elders) is the first line of defense against dysfunction.
*   **Autonomy:** The State respects the privacy of the home but will intervene swiftly to protect the child.
