# Title 1: The Sovereign Medical & Bioethics Code

## Section 101: The Philosophy of Healing
1.  **Service to Life:** In the Sovereign Digital Nation, medicine is a sacred duty dedicated to the preservation, optimization, and healing of the human body (The Temple). It is not a mechanism for infinite profit extraction.
2.  **The Image Bearer:** All medical and biological interventions must respect that Mankind is made in the image of God. We seek to heal and optimize, not to subvert or replace the fundamental nature of humanity.

## Section 102: The Bioethics Mandate
1.  **Pre-Natal Optimization:** As established in the National Service Act, genetic screening and nutritional optimization are mandated to ensure the highest biological potential of the citizenry.
2.  **Prohibitions (The Transhumanist Ban):**
    *   **Cloning:** The cloning of human beings for any purpose (reproduction or parts harvesting) is strictly prohibited.
    *   **Chimeras:** The creation of human-animal hybrids or chimeras is classified as a High Crime against Purity.
    *   **Cybernetic Subjugation:** Cybernetic enhancements that override human free will, connect the brain directly to an external coercive network, or attempt to transfer consciousness into a machine are prohibited.

## Section 103: The Anti-Extortion Medical Protocol
1.  **Essential Medicines:** Drugs required for the immediate preservation of life (e.g., insulin, epinephrine, antibiotics) are classified as "Essential Goods."
2.  **The Profit Cap:** It is illegal to patent a naturally occurring biological compound. For synthesized life-saving drugs, the profit margin is legally capped at **20% above the cost of manufacture and verifiable R&D amortization**. Charging extortionate prices for a captive, dying market is a crime of Usury.
3.  **Medical Debt:** Debt incurred for necessary, life-saving medical treatment cannot be inherited by the Family Estate. Upon the death of the patient, the debt is extinguished.

## Section 104: End of Life (The 130-Year Horizon)
1.  **The Goal:** The Nation supports medical technology designed to optimize the human lifespan up to its recognized biological ceiling of **130 Years**.
2.  **The Right to Natural Death:**
    *   While the State mandates the preservation of life, it recognizes the boundary of the soul.
    *   **Prohibition on Euthanasia:** Active, intentional euthanasia (the deliberate administration of lethal compounds) is prohibited as a violation of the Divine Hierarchy (God is the author of life and death).
    *   **Palliative Allowance:** However, citizens possess the absolute right to refuse "infinite mechanical preservation" (e.g., indefinite ventilators when brain death is imminent) and transition to purely palliative care, allowing a natural passing.

## Section 105: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
