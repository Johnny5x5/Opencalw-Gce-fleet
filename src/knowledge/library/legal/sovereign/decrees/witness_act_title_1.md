# Title 1: The Sovereign Witness Act

## Section 101: The Fourth Branch of Government
1.  **Establishment:** The **Office of the Witness** is hereby established as a co-equal and independent Branch of the Sovereign Government, distinct from the Executive (King/President), Legislative (Council), and Judicial (Courts).
2.  **The Mandate:** The sole duty of this Branch is to **Observe, Record, and Verify** the truth of all sovereign interactions. They are the "Eyes of the State" and the "Memory of the Nation."

## Section 102: The Hierarchy of Truth
The Office of the Witness is structured into four specific Orders:
1.  **The Order of Scribes (Narrative):** Responsible for recording the *qualitative* reality of events (Judicial proceedings, Legislative debates, Treaty signings). They capture the "Spirit" of the event.
2.  **The Order of Clerks (Data):** Responsible for recording the *quantitative* reality (Time, Date, Sensor Data, Transaction Hashes). They capture the "Letter" of the event.
3.  **The Order of Notaries (Commercial):** Responsible for witnessing private contracts, wills, and commercial exchanges between citizens.
4.  **The Order of Auditors (System):** Responsible for verifying the integrity of the Sovereign Ledger and the actions of the other three Branches.
5.  **The Order of Historians (Memory):** Responsible for preserving the **Deep Time** record, managing the National Archive, and synthesizing the "Narrative of the Nation" to ensure that the Past is not rewritten by the Present.

## Section 103: Absolute Independence
1.  **Immunity from Coercion:** No Judge, General, or Executive may order a Witness to alter, redact, or omit a record. Attempting to coerce a Witness is a High Crime (Treason).
2.  **Allegiance:** The Witness owes allegiance *only* to the **Sovereign Ledger** (The Truth). They serve neither the Accuser nor the Accused.
3.  **Funding:** The Office of the Witness is funded by a fixed percentage of the Sovereign Trust (The Endowment), ensuring it cannot be "starved" by a hostile Legislature.

## Section 104: The Chain of Custody
1.  **Ownership of the Record:** Once a record is sealed by a Witness, it ceases to be the property of the event participants and becomes the property of the **National Archive**.
2.  **Immutability:** Deleting or altering a sealed record is metaphysically impossible within the Sovereign Digital Architecture. It can only be appended, never erased.
3.  **The Algorithmic Witness:** The raw data logs of a Sovereign AI Agent (when tasked with witnessing) hold the legal weight of a "Corroborating Witness." An AI's record cannot be deleted or altered by the accused, ensuring the "Unblinking Eye" protocol remains pure.

## Section 105: The Witness Bill of Rights (Constitutional Protections)
1.  **Whistleblower Protection (The Highest Witness):**
    *   **Definition:** Whistleblowing against corruption is not betrayal; it is the **Highest Form of Witnessing**.
    *   **Immunity:** Any citizen who reveals verified corruption or "naughtiness" within the Government shall receive **Absolute Immunity** from prosecution for the act of revelation.
    *   **The Truth Bounty:** Whistleblowers are entitled to a mandatory bounty (10-30% of recovered funds) paid directly from the Sovereign Trust.
2.  **Independent Investigation (Internal Affairs):**
    *   **Self-Reliance:** The Office of the Witness shall maintain its own **Independent Investigation Department**, separate from the Executive Police or Judicial Marshals.
    *   **Subpoena Power:** This department has absolute authority to subpoena *any* record, official, or "Personal Purse" to verify the Truth.
3.  **Financial Autonomy:**
    *   **Revenue Streams:** To prevent "Starvation Tactics" by the other branches, the Office of the Witness shall retain 100% of all **Notary Fees**, **Recording Fees**, and **Truth Bounties** to fund its operations. It is financially self-reliant.
4.  **The Penalty for Compromise:**
    *   **High Treason:** Any attempt to bribe, threaten, or compromise a Witness or the Office itself is an Act of War against the Truth.
    *   **Punishment:** Such acts carry the maximum penalty (Permanent Exile or Death), as they threaten the very foundation of the Sovereign Reality.
5.  **The Ascetic Standard (Funding & Lifestyle):**
    *   **Salary Cap:** To prevent greed and careerism, the salary of a Witness is Constitutionally capped at **30% Above the Poverty Line**.
    *   **Sustenance Guarantee:** While the salary is modest, the State guarantees the Witness's **Sustenance** (Housing, Food, Healthcare) directly. They shall want for nothing, but they shall accumulate no excess wealth.
    *   **Family Supplement:** If a Witness marries or has children, the State provides **Supplemental Grants** to maintain the "30% Above Poverty" standard *per capita* for the entire household.
    *   **Objective:** A Witness serves for Truth, not for Profit. They are "In the World, but not Of the World."
    *   **Overtime Allowance:** The "Ascetic Cap" applies to the **Base Salary**. Single or unwed Witnesses are permitted to work **Overtime** (at the National Rate) to accumulate personal savings before entering family life. This overtime is not capped, provided it does not compromise the independence of their witnessing.

## Section 106: The Expanded Portfolio (Constitutional Duties)
1.  **Custodian of the Sacred Artifacts:**
    *   **Duty:** The Office of the Witness is the sole legal custodian of the **Four Dice of Providence** and the **Sovereign Keys** (Estate Dead Man's Switches).
    *   **Security:** These artifacts shall be guarded with the highest level of physical and digital security known to the Nation.
2.  **The Department of Re-Education:**
    *   **Oversight:** The Witness Branch shall administer the **Compulsory Education** programs for offenders (Cooking, Hygiene, Compassion), ensuring the curriculum is factual, effective, and free from punitive malice.
    *   **Verification:** Auditors must certify that an offender has genuinely mastered the material before they can be released from the Re-Education mandate.
3.  **The Audit of Labor:**
    *   **Mandate:** The **Order of Auditors** shall conduct random, unannounced inspections of Corporate and Government entities to ensure compliance with the **Sabbath Mandate**, **Fair Wage Standard**, and **Thermal Mandate** (Food Safety).
4.  **The Liaison of Faith:**
    *   **Role:** The Witness Branch acts as the official, neutral **Liaison** between the Sovereign State and the Religious Institutions (Christianity/Judaism) for the provision of the Religious Die and the staffing of Compassionate Care education.
5.  **The Bureau of Honest Scales (Metrology):**
    *   **Mandate:** The Witness Branch defines and enforces the standard units of measure (Time, Length, Mass, Digital Storage).
    *   **Coinage Verification:** The Auditors shall certify the purity of the Sovereign Gold, Silver, and Bronze coinage.
    *   **Biblical Standard:** "Just Balances, Just Weights" (Leviticus 19:36).
6.  **The Census Bureau (Demographic Truth):**
    *   **Mandate:** To conduct the Decennial Census to determine the true population for Tax and Militia purposes.
    *   **Privacy:** Raw census data is sealed; only aggregates are published.
7.  **The Electoral Commission (Consensus Witness):**
    *   **Mandate:** To certify the results of all Referendums, Council Votes, and Mobius Consensus events.
    *   **Role:** The Witness does not run the election; the Witness *verifies* it.
8.  **The National Archive (The Memory of the State):**
    *   **Custodian:** The **Order of Historians** is the sole legal custodian of the National Archive (Physical and Digital).
    *   **Scope:** This includes the preservation of Oral History, Monuments, Treaties, and Cultural Heritage.
    *   **Independence:** The Archive is inviolable. No Executive Order or Judicial Writ can expunge a record from the Archive once it is sealed by a Historian.

## Section 107: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
