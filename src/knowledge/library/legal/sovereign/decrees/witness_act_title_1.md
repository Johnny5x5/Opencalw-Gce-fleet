# Title 1: The Sovereign Witness Act

## Section 101: The Fourth Branch of Government
1.  **Establishment:** The **Office of the Witness** is hereby established as a co-equal and independent Branch of the Sovereign Government, distinct from the Executive (King/President), Legislative (Council), and Judicial (Courts).
2.  **The Mandate:** The sole duty of this Branch is to **Observe, Record, and Verify** the truth of all sovereign interactions. They are the "Eyes of the State" and the "Memory of the Nation."

## Section 102: The Hierarchy of Truth
The Office of the Witness is structured into four specific Orders:
1.  **The Order of Scribes (Narrative):** Responsible for recording the *qualitative* reality of events (Judicial proceedings, Legislative debates, Treaty signings). They capture the "Spirit" of the event.
2.  **The Order of Clerks (Data):** Responsible for recording the *quantitative* reality (Time, Date, Sensor Data, Transaction Hashes). They capture the "Letter" of the event.
3.  **The Order of Notaries (Commercial):** Responsible for witnessing private contracts, wills, and commercial exchanges between citizens.
4.  **The Order of Auditors (System):** Responsible for verifying the integrity of the Sovereign Ledger and the actions of the other three Branches.

## Section 103: Absolute Independence
1.  **Immunity from Coercion:** No Judge, General, or Executive may order a Witness to alter, redact, or omit a record. Attempting to coerce a Witness is a High Crime (Treason).
2.  **Allegiance:** The Witness owes allegiance *only* to the **Sovereign Ledger** (The Truth). They serve neither the Accuser nor the Accused.
3.  **Funding:** The Office of the Witness is funded by a fixed percentage of the Sovereign Trust (The Endowment), ensuring it cannot be "starved" by a hostile Legislature.

## Section 104: The Chain of Custody
1.  **Ownership of the Record:** Once a record is sealed by a Witness, it ceases to be the property of the event participants and becomes the property of the **National Archive**.
2.  **Immutability:** Deleting or altering a sealed record is metaphysically impossible within the Sovereign Digital Architecture. It can only be appended, never erased.

## Section 105: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
