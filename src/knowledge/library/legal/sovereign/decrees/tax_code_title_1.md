# Title 1: The Tax Code of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## Section 101: The Sovereign Endowment (Birthright)
1.  **Initial Sum:** Every citizen shall receive an initial endowment at birth (or naturalization), funded by the Sovereign Tax Pool.
2.  **Purpose:** To ensure no citizen starts at zero. This Trust funds education, health, and dignity.

## Section 102: The Investment Mandate (The 10-Generation Horizon)
1.  **Compound Growth:** The Endowment shall be invested in diversified, long-term assets to ensure compound interest for the citizen's future.
2.  **The 10-Generation Strategy:**
    *   **Timeframe:** All State-managed investments (Endowments and Family Trusts) shall be calibrated for a **10-Generation Horizon** (approx. 250-300 years).
    *   **Objective:** To secure the financial sovereignty of the lineage, not just the individual.
    *   **Withdrawal Limits:** Principal restrictions shall apply to ensure the capital base grows to support future generations.

## Section 103: Prohibition on Inheritance Tax
1.  **Dynasty Protocol:** No tax shall be levied on the transfer of wealth from parent to child. The fruit of a family's labor belongs to the family.

## Section 104: The Household Tax Standard
1.  **Assessment Unit:** Taxes shall be levied on the **Household** (Family Unit), not the individual.
2.  **Flat Rate:** The Household shall contribute a flat tax of **ten percent (10%)** of their total annual income to the Sovereign Treasury.
3.  **Family Estate Exemption:** Wages deposited directly into the **Family Estate Trust** (e.g., Co-Teaching Compensation) for long-term investment are **Tax-Deferred** until withdrawal.
4.  **Welfare Contribution:** A partial percentage of the Co-Teaching wages shall be diverted to the **General Welfare Pool** to fund the Minimum Welfare Standard.

## Section 105: The Minimum Welfare Standard (Contribution-Linked)
1.  **Hybrid System:** The Sovereign Welfare System is not a handout; it is a **Reciprocal Benefit** linked to service.
2.  **Institutional Guarantees:** The Household Standard institutionalizes the following responsibilities of the State:
    *   **Housing:** Guaranteed adequate shelter for every household.
    *   **Sustenance:** Guaranteed nutritional baseline.
    *   **Healthcare:** Comprehensive coverage for all family members, including the **Educational Healthcare Guarantee** for enrolled students up to Age 35.
    *   **Education:** Full funding of the 16th Grade Mandate.
3.  **Vesting & Benefit:**
    *   **Direct Benefit:** Those who contribute labor (Co-Teaching) receive a direct, compound benefit to their **Family Estate** after a mandatory period of long-term investment.
    *   **The Dividend:** Welfare support is distributed as a "Family Dividend" to the Head of Household, ensuring the dignity and stability of the family unit.

## Section 106: Corporate Taxation Strategy
1.  **Standard Rate:** All corporations pay **10%** on net profits.
2.  **Global Enterprise Incentive:** Corporations with global revenue > $1B pay **5%**.

## Section 106: The Corporate Covenant
1.  **Condition:** To qualify for the reduced rates (3-5%), a corporation must abide by the **Biblical Laws of Commerce** (No Usury, Fair Wages, Sabbath Rest).
2.  **Penalty:** Violation results in **Revocation of Charter** (Corporate Death Penalty).
