# Title 1: The Tax Code of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## Section 101: The Sovereign Endowment (Birthright)
1.  **Initial Sum:** Every citizen shall receive an initial endowment at birth (or naturalization), funded by the Sovereign Tax Pool.
2.  **Purpose:** To ensure no citizen starts at zero. This Trust funds education, health, and dignity.

## Section 102: The Investment Mandate
1.  **Compound Growth:** The Endowment shall be invested in diversified, long-term assets to ensure compound interest for the citizen's future.

## Section 103: The Dynasty Protocol & The Family Welfare Estate
1.  **0% Inheritance Tax:** The Sovereign Nation strictly prohibits percentage-based wealth seizures upon death. The fruit of a family's labor belongs to the family.
2.  **The Token Tax:** To fund the bureaucratic and algorithmic processing of the estate transfer, a flat fee is assessed: One (1) Grand Note (1,000 SC) per year of the deceased's lifespan.
3.  **The Ancestral Corpus:** Upon death, the Citizen's Personal Estate (including their Sovereign Trust) is bundled into a new container called the "Ancestral Corpus" and transferred into the overarching **Family Welfare Estate**.

## Section 104: The 50-Year Jubilee Lockup
1.  **The Lock:** The principal of the Ancestral Corpus shall be strictly locked and invested for exactly fifty (50) years (One Jubilee cycle) from the date of transfer. It cannot be liquidated by the heirs.
2.  **The Yield (Post-Lockup):** After 50 years, the Corpus begins generating an accessible yield. Exactly **15% of the cash flow** is siphoned for the Family Welfare Estate; the remaining 85% is perpetually reinvested into the Corpus.

## Section 105: The Siphon Distribution (7/8 Split)
The 15% active cash flow is divided into two streams to ensure survival and future growth:
1.  **The 7% Immediate Yield (The Bread):** Reinvested into a high-liquidity vehicle that pays out to living family members strictly on a **Needs-Based, Non-Cash** basis (e.g., directly paying healthcare, housing, or food suppliers).
2.  **The 8% Future Yield (The Seed):** Invested directly into the futures of the family members using predictive "Ahead of Time" algorithms (e.g., funding future education, business incubation, or unborn descendants).

## Section 106: The Sovereign Tithe (Personal Tax)
1.  **Flat Tax:** Every citizen shall contribute a flat tax of **ten percent (10%)** of their annual income to the Sovereign Treasury.
2.  **Scope:** This applies to all income sources.

## Section 107: Corporate Taxation Strategy
1.  **Standard Rate:** All corporations pay **10%** on net profits.
2.  **Global Enterprise Incentive:** Corporations with global revenue > $1B pay **5%**.
3.  **Loyalty Discount:** Corporations conducting 100% of operations within the Sovereign Network pay **3%**.

## Section 108: The Corporate Covenant
1.  **Condition:** To qualify for the reduced rates (3-5%), a corporation must abide by the **Biblical Laws of Commerce** (No Usury, Fair Wages, Sabbath Rest).
2.  **Penalty:** Violation results in **Revocation of Charter** (Corporate Death Penalty).
