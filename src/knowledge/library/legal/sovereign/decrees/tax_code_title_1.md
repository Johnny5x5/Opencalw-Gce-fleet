# Title 1: The Tax Code of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## Section 101: The Sovereign Endowment (Birthright)
1.  **Initial Sum:** Every citizen shall receive an initial endowment at birth (or naturalization), funded by the Sovereign Tax Pool.
2.  **Purpose:** To ensure no citizen starts at zero. This Trust funds education, health, and dignity.

## Section 102: The Investment Mandate
1.  **Compound Growth:** The Endowment shall be invested in diversified, long-term assets to ensure compound interest for the citizen's future.

## Section 103: The Dynasty Protocol & The Family Welfare Estate
1.  **0% Inheritance Tax:** The Sovereign Nation strictly prohibits percentage-based wealth seizures upon death. The fruit of a family's labor belongs to the family.
2.  **The Token Tax:** To fund the bureaucratic and algorithmic processing of the estate transfer, a flat fee is assessed: One (1) Grand Note (1,000 SC) per year of the deceased's lifespan.
3.  **The Ancestral Corpus:** Upon death, the Citizen's Personal Estate (including their Sovereign Trust) is bundled into a new container called the "Ancestral Corpus" and transferred into the overarching **Family Welfare Estate**.

## Section 104: The 50-Year Jubilee Lockup
1.  **The Lock:** The principal of the Ancestral Corpus shall be strictly locked and invested for exactly fifty (50) years (One Jubilee cycle) from the date of transfer. It cannot be liquidated by the heirs.
2.  **The Yield (Post-Lockup):** After 50 years, the Corpus begins generating an accessible yield. Exactly **15% of the cash flow** is siphoned for the Family Welfare Estate; the remaining 85% is perpetually reinvested into the Corpus.

## Section 105: The Twain (The 7/8 Siphon Distribution)
The 15% active cash flow is divided into two intertwined mechanisms—The Twain—to ensure survival and future growth without inducing moral decay:
1.  **The Solomonic Tether (7%):** Reinvested into a high-liquidity vehicle that pays out to living family members strictly on a **Needs-Based, Non-Cash** basis (e.g., directly paying healthcare, housing, or food suppliers).
    *   *The Solomonic Cap:* Payouts are subject to a strict maximum annual and lifetime limit (the "What is Enough" cap). This prevents the citizen from obtaining unattainable, corrupting wealth, fulfilling the proverb: "Give me neither poverty nor riches."
2.  **The Vanguard Seed (8%):** Invested directly into the futures of the family members using predictive "Ahead of Time" algorithms (e.g., funding future education, business incubation, or unborn descendants).

## Section 106: The Sovereign Tithe and The Lifespan Curve
1.  **The Base Tax:** Every citizen shall contribute a baseline tax of **ten percent (10%)** of their annual income to the Sovereign Treasury.
2.  **The Grind (Ages 0-30):** During the first 30 years of a Citizen's economic life, the tax rate remains heavy and fixed to instill the value of labor, discipline, and character building.
3.  **The Jubilee Tax Decay:** Upon entering the "Reaping Phase" (Post-30), the Citizen becomes eligible for the Tax Decay mechanism. For every subsequent 7 years of life (one Shemitah cycle), their National Tax rate shall decrease by exactly **0.000001%**.
4.  **Prerequisites for Decay:** To qualify for the Jubilee Tax Decay, the Citizen must:
    *   Have accumulated at least **21 years** of "National Work Credits" (which need not be consecutive).
    *   Have successfully passed the **Mandatory Sovereign Education** curriculum.
5.  **The Purpose:** This ensures that long-lived citizens who have contributed to the Nation eventually age into a practically tax-free existence, reaping the benefits of a century of labor.

## Section 107: Corporate Taxation Strategy
1.  **Standard Rate:** All corporations pay **10%** on net profits.
2.  **Global Enterprise Incentive:** Corporations with global revenue > $1B pay **5%**.
3.  **Loyalty Discount:** Corporations conducting 100% of operations within the Sovereign Network pay **3%**.

## Section 108: The Corporate Covenant
1.  **Condition:** To qualify for the reduced rates (3-5%), a corporation must abide by the **Biblical Laws of Commerce** (No Usury, Fair Wages, Sabbath Rest).
2.  **Penalty:** Violation results in **Revocation of Charter** (Corporate Death Penalty).
