## Section 101: The Sovereign Endowment (Birthright)
1.  **Initial Sum:** Every citizen shall receive an initial endowment at birth (or naturalization), funded by the Sovereign Tax Pool.
2.  **Purpose:** To ensure no citizen starts at zero. This Trust funds education, health, and dignity.

## Section 106: The Corporate Covenant
1.  **Condition:** To qualify for the reduced rates (3-5%), a corporation must abide by the **Biblical Laws of Commerce** (No Usury, Fair Wages, Sabbath Rest).
2.  **Penalty:** Violation results in **Revocation of Charter** (Corporate Death Penalty).
