# Title 1: The Sovereign Monetary Act

## Section 101: The Gold Standard
1.  **The Standard:** The monetary unit of the Sovereign Digital Nation shall be defined by a fixed weight of **Pure Gold**.
2.  **Reserve:** The Sovereign Treasury is mandated to maintain physical gold reserves sufficient to back the digital currency in circulation.
3.  **Stability:** Gold serves as the anchor of value, protecting the citizenry from inflation and debasement.

## Section 102: The Hybrid Monetary Basket (The Standard)
1.  **Multi-Asset Backing:** In addition to Gold, the Nation recognizes the following as lawful money and reserve assets:
    *   **Silver:** Designated as the primary medium for commercial exchange and daily trade.
    *   **Copper:** Designated as "Infrastructure Currency," representing connectivity and energy.
    *   **Tin:** Designated as "Alloy Currency," representing the capacity for fusion and strength (Bronze Age resilience).
    *   **Iron & Steel:** Designated as "Utility Currency," representing the industrial strength and defensive capacity of the Nation.
    *   **Salt:** Designated as "Vital Currency," representing the preservation of life and historical value.
2.  **Exchange Rates:** The Treasury shall publish fixed daily exchange rates between Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Iron, Steel, and Salt based on global market realities and strategic reserves.

## Section 103: Digital Integration (Backed Fiat)
1.  **The Digital Token:** The "Fiat Currency" circulating within the Sovereign Network is a digital representation fully backed by the physical basket of assets.
2.  **100% Backing:** Every unit of digital currency corresponds to a tangible claim on the Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Iron, Steel, or Salt reserves.
3.  **Prohibition on Unbacked Fiat:** The creation of currency *not* backed by these hard assets (fractional reserve banking) is strictly prohibited.
4.  **Verification:** The physical reserves shall be auditable by any citizen at any time (Proof of Reserve).

## Section 104: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
