# Intent: The Sovereign Medical & Bioethics Code

## 1. Healing vs. Extortion
The modern medical industry often treats the sick as a captive market to be squeezed.
*   **The Profit Cap:** We allow pharmaceutical companies to recover their R&D and make a fair 20% profit. We *do not* allow them to buy the patent for insulin and raise the price by 5000%. That is not capitalism; it is hostage-taking.
*   **Generational Shield:** A grandfather's cancer treatment should not bankrupt the grandson. Medical debt dies with the body.

## 2. Optimization vs. Subversion
We are building a nation of highly optimized humans capable of living 130 years. However, there is a hard line between *healing* the body and *abandoning* humanity.
*   **The Transhumanist Ban:** We reject the ideology that man must merge with the machine to become a god. We ban cloning and mind-uploading. We optimize the Temple; we do not replace it with a server rack.

## 3. The Sanctity of the End
*   We reject active euthanasia because we do not hold the keys to life and death.
*   We equally reject the cruel torture of keeping a body artificially animated for years when the soul is ready to depart. There is dignity in a natural passing.
