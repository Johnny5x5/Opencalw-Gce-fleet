# Intent: The Sovereign Corporate Code (Title 1)

## 1. The Problem
Modern corporate law allows companies to act as sociopathic entities, paying fines for illegal behavior as a simple "cost of doing business." When states seize corporate assets, they often keep the money, creating a perverse incentive for the state to target wealthy companies for profit.

## 2. The Goal
We establish a system where **Corporate Evil is Fatal, but the State is not a Thief.**
*   We institute the "Corporate Death Penalty" for egregious moral failures (Usury, Slavery).
*   We mandate "Double Restitution" to the actual victims, aligning with Biblical law.
*   We mandate the return of surplus to shareholders, preventing the State from looting.

## 3. The Limitation
The "Impoundment Protocol" exists specifically to protect innocent workers and prevent the State from executing a "Guilty until proven innocent" raid. The 6-month limit forces a speedy, transparent trial.
