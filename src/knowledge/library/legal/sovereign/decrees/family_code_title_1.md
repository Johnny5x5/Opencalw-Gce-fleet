# Title 1: The Sovereign Family Code

## Section 101: The Definition of Marriage (The Covenant)
1.  **Contractual Nature:** Marriage in the Sovereign Digital Nation is not merely a social ritual but a **Binding Covenant** between two Sovereign Citizens for the purpose of creating a **Household** and continuing a **Lineage**.
2.  **The Household Unit:** Upon marriage, the two individuals cease to be taxed as individuals and become a single **Economic Entity** (The Household) under the Tax Code.
3.  **The 10-Generation Commitment:** The Marriage Covenant explicitly acknowledges the duty to build a **Family Estate** that will endure for 10 generations.

## Section 102: The Parental License (The Privilege)
1.  **Restriction:** As per the National Service Act, no citizen may bear or father a child before the age of **27** (Standard) or **30** (Optimized).
2.  **Prerequisites:** To obtain a **Parental License**, the couple must demonstrate:
    *   **Financial Stability:** The Household must be solvent and contributing to the Sovereign Trust.
    *   **Educational Completion:** Both parents must have completed their 16th Grade Mandate (or be in good standing).
    *   **Service Completion:** Both parents must have completed their mandatory **Pre-Parental Service** (Co-Teaching/Teacher's Aide).
3.  **Waiver:** Unlicensed procreation is a violation of the Sovereign Contract, triggering mandatory **remedial parenting classes** and potential financial penalties (though no child shall be deemed "illegal").

## Section 103: Divorce (The Dissolution Protocol)
1.  **Zero Ambiguity:** Divorce is treated as a **Breach of Contract**.
2.  **Mandatory Mediation:** Before a petition for divorce can be filed, the couple must undergo a mandatory **6-Month Cooling-Off Period** and **Restorative Counseling**.
3.  **Asset Division:**
    *   **Default:** Assets acquired during the marriage are split **50/50**.
    *   **Pre-Nuptial Agreements:** The State strongly encourages **Pre-Nuptial Agreements** to clarify asset division *before* the marriage begins.
4.  **Child Custody (The Child's Right):**
    *   **Default:** Custody is awarded **50/50 Shared Parenting** unless there is proven abuse or neglect.
    *   **Objective:** The child has a right to both parents. The State will not facilitate parental alienation.

## Section 104: The Family Council
1.  **Governance:** Every Household is encouraged to form a **Family Council** (including grandparents/elders) to manage the Family Estate and resolve internal disputes before they escalate to the Courts.
2.  **Autonomy:** The State respects the autonomy of the Family Unit and intervenes only when the **Rights of the Child** or the **Sovereign Contract** are violated.

## Section 105: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
