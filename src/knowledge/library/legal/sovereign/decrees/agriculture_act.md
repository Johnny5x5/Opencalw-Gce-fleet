2.  **Personal Gleaning:** The harvesting of crops that grow naturally (volunteer crops) without human intervention during a rest year for personal consumption.
3.  **Sabbatical Year (Jubilee):** Every seventh (7th) year in the Sovereign Calendar, designated as a year of rest for the land.
4.  **Grand Jubilee Year:** Every fiftieth (50th) year in the Sovereign Calendar.
5.  **Fallow Period:** The designated time during a Jubilee or Grand Jubilee year where commercial agricultural operations cease to allow soil regeneration.

2.  **Land Rest:** The land shall lie fallow. No machinery shall be used to till or cultivate the soil for profit.
3.  **Purpose:** This period is mandated to allow the soil to regenerate its nutrients, structure, and microbial life naturally.

## Section 3: The Grand Jubilee Moratorium
1.  **Commercial Ban:** During a Grand Jubilee Year (Year 50, 100, etc.), all **Commercial Agriculture** activities are strictly prohibited.
2.  **Generational Reset:** This period ensures that land fertility is preserved for future generations, preventing long-term degradation.
