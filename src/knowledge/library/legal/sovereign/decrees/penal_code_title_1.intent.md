# Intent: The Jubilee & Anti-Profit Act

## 1. The Problem
The modern prison-industrial complex has become a moral abomination. Prisons are warehouses for human beings, often driven by profit motives that encourage longer sentences and recidivism. The system destroys lives rather than restoring them.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Restorative Justice System** based on Biblical principles:
*   **Jubilee:** A hard limit on punishment (7 Years) prevents institutionalization.
*   **Restitution:** The focus is on paying back the victim, not rotting in a cell.
*   **Anti-Profit:** Removing the profit motive eliminates the incentive to incarcerate.

## 3. The Limitation
This law does not apply to **Existential Threats** (e.g., Nuclear Terrorism, High Treason). In those rare cases (>950 Moral Weight), the safety of the Nation requires **Permanent Removal** (Exile or Death), as 7 years is insufficient for safety.
