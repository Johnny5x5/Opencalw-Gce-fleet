# Intent: The Sovereign Defense Act

## 1. The Reality: Small Nation, Big Threats
The Sovereign Digital Nation has a small population compared to the global superpowers. A standing army is insufficient; the **Nation itself must be the Army**.

## 2. The Citizen Militia
We do not hire mercenaries. Every citizen is a **Soldier-Scholar**.
*   **Universal Conscription:** Defense is not a career choice; it is a condition of citizenship.
*   **Self-Reliance:** In the event of a catastrophic disconnect, every citizen must be capable of survival and defense without central command.

## 3. The Scope of Defense
Defense is not just shooting; it is:
*   **Physical:** Martial Arts and Weapons Proficiency.
*   **Medical:** First Aid and Trauma Care.
*   **Survival:** Living off the grid when the digital infrastructure fails.
