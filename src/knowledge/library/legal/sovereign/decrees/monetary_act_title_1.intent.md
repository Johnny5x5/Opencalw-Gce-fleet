# Intent: The Sovereign Monetary Act

## 1. The Problem: Fiat Decay
Modern fiat currencies are detached from reality, prone to infinite inflation, and dependent on the whim of central bankers. A Sovereign Nation requires Sovereign Money—money that cannot be printed into worthlessness.

## 2. The Gold Standard (The Anchor)
We return to the **Gold Standard** as the ultimate measure of value. Gold is scarce, immutable, and universally recognized. It anchors our digital economy to the physical world.

## 3. The Hybrid System (Iron, Silver, Steel, Bronze)
We do not rely on Gold alone. We recognize the value of **Utility** and **Strength**.
*   **Silver:** The "People's Money" for commerce and trade.
*   **Iron & Steel:** The "Builder's Money." By recognizing industrial metals as currency, we link the nation's wealth directly to its capacity to build, defend, and endure.
*   **Bronze:** The "Historical Money." We acknowledge the alloy that built the first empires.

## 4. The Polymer Standard (Physical Resilience)
Our physical currency must be as durable as our philosophy. We reject the fragile paper/cotton standard of the old world (US Dollar).
*   **Oil-Based:** We use **Polymer (Plastic)** notes because they are waterproof, tear-proof, and hygienic.
*   **New Zealand Model:** We adopt the highest standard of anti-counterfeiting and durability.

## 5. Hard Money for a Digital World
While our transactions may be digital, every unit of account is backed by hard, physical reality. We do not trade in debt; we trade in substance.
