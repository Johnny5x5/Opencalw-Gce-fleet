# Intent: The Sovereign Resource & Land Act

## 1. The Core Philosophy: The Earth is Not Ours
We explicitly reject the modern industrial philosophy that the earth is a dead machine meant to be ground into dust for quarterly profits. We are tenants. The landlord is God.
*   **The 10-Generation Test:** If a farming or mining practice leaves the soil dead or the water toxic for the grandchildren, it is a crime.

## 2. The Mechanics of the Jubilee (Rest & Resilience)
Endless extraction leads to systemic collapse—both ecological and economic. The Jubilee is the engineered safeguard against that collapse.
*   **The 7-Year Rest:** By forcing a complete halt to commercial extraction every seven years, we force the land to heal, the fish to spawn, and the soil to rest. We also force our economy to be resilient enough to survive a planned pause, rather than addicted to constant growth.
*   **The Sustenance Right:** The law punishes *greed*, not *need*. A man can always feed his family from the earth, even during the Jubilee. He just cannot strip-mine it to sell to foreigners.

## 3. The Livestock Bridge (The Survival Tactic)
Resting the land does not mean starving the people.
*   **The Tactic:** While the crops and forests rest, the Nation leans heavily into its Animal Husbandry. By intentionally ramping up cattle and herd production during the Jubilee, we create a massive "Caloric Bridge" to sustain the population.
*   **Synergy:** The grazing herds naturally fertilize the fallow fields, preparing the soil for the post-Jubilee planting cycle.

## 4. The Grand Reset (50 Years)
Without a reset, capital naturally aggregates into the hands of a few, eventually creating a permanent class of landless serfs.
*   The 50-Year Grand Jubilee is the Sovereign "Ctrl+Alt+Delete" on feudalism. It ensures that every 50 years, the deck is reshuffled, preventing the permanent monopolization of the physical earth by dynastic corporations.
