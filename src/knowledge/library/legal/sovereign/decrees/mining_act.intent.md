# Intent: The Sovereign Mineral & Subsurface Stewardship Act

## 1. The Problem
Commercial mining extracts non-renewable resources, often causing irreversible environmental damage and exploiting the land for short-term gain. Continuous extraction without pauses leads to rapid depletion and ecological scarring.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Mineral Stewardship System** based on Biblical principles of rest and limitation:
*   **Jubilee Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory cessation of all commercial extraction every 7th year, allowing the land to "breathe" and communities to focus on processing, safety, and reclamation.
*   **Grand Jubilee Rest (50th Year):** A complete commercial moratorium every 50th year, forcing a generational reassessment of resource needs and preventing over-exploitation.
*   **Safety & Reclamation:** Unlike biological resources, minerals do not "regenerate." The Jubilee year is designated for **Reclamation** (healing the land) and **Safety Audits** (protecting the workers).

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Commercial Ban:** Strict prohibition on active mining, drilling, or quarrying during Jubilee years.
*   **Maintenance Focus:** The moratorium is designated for equipment repair, mine safety improvements, and environmental reclamation projects.
