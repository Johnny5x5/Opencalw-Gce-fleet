# Intent: The Sovereign Wildlife Management & Conservation Act

## 1. The Problem
Commercial exploitation of wildlife disrupts ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and often leads to the extinction of species. Hunting and trapping must be balanced with conservation.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Wildlife Management System** based on Biblical principles of dominion and respect:
*   **Jubilee Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory cessation of all commercial hunting and trapping every 7th year, allowing animal populations to rebound and diversify.
*   **Grand Jubilee Rest (50th Year):** A complete commercial moratorium every 50th year, ensuring generational genetic diversity.
*   **Personal Provision:** Personal hunting and trapping for sustenance (meat, fur) is permitted, but strictly regulated to ensure sustainability.
*   **Protection of the Vulnerable:** Pregnant females and young offspring are protected during breeding seasons.

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Commercial Ban:** Strict prohibition on commercial hunting guides, fur trapping for export, and exotic animal trade during Jubilee years.
*   **Generational Recovery:** The moratorium is designated to allow animal populations to recover from hunting pressure.
