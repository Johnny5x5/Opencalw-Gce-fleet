# Intent: The Sovereign Civic Infrastructure Act

## 1. The Anti-Sprawl Philosophy
Governments have a natural tendency to bloat. They buy up land, build massive sprawling campuses, and slowly turn entire regions into bureaucratic wastelands that produce nothing but red tape.
*   **The 1-Mile Cage:** We put the bureaucracy in a cage. A Sovereign Civic Center cannot exceed 1 square mile. If the government needs to service a million people from that site, they must engineer hyper-efficient, vertical architecture.
*   **The Mall Metaphor:** A modern mega-mall can process hundreds of thousands of people efficiently in a tight footprint. The Government must adopt this spatial efficiency.

## 2. The Neutral Ground
For Face-to-Face Restitution to work without erupting into violence, there must be a place of absolute, enforced neutrality.
*   **The Forum:** The Civic Center acts as the modern "City of Refuge." It is a heavily guarded sanctuary where enemies can meet to settle debts in safety, under the watchful eye of the Sovereign Witness and the Militia.
