# Intent: The Sovereign Fishing & Aquatic Resource Act

## 1. The Problem
Commercial overfishing depletes the natural resources of the Sovereign Digital Nation, threatening the long-term sustainability of our aquatic ecosystems. Continuous extraction without rest periods leads to ecological collapse.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Resource Management System** based on Biblical principles of rest and stewardship:
*   **Jubilee Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory cessation of all commercial fishing every 7th year allows fish stocks to replenish naturally.
*   **Grand Jubilee Rest (50th Year):** A complete commercial moratorium every 50th year to ensure generational renewal.
*   **Personal Provision:** Personal fishing for sustenance is always permitted, recognizing the individual's right to feed themselves and their family.

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Commercial Ban:** Strict prohibition on industrial-scale harvesting during Jubilee years.
*   **Maintenance Period:** The moratorium is designated as a time for "Maintenance & Rebuilding," allowing the ecosystem to heal and the industry to repair equipment without pressure to produce.
