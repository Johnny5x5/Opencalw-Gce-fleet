# Title 1: The Sovereign Education Act

## Section 101: The 16-Year Compulsory Education Mandate
1.  **The Sovereign Baseline:** The Sovereign Digital Nation hereby establishes a mandatory, state-funded, 16-year education curriculum for all citizens. This curriculum encompasses Kindergarten through the 14th Grade (equivalent to a two-year Associate's Degree or Advanced Trade Certification).
2.  **Universal Requirement:** This standard is compulsory for all youth raised within the Nation and retroactively required for all adult citizens seeking to maintain full civic standing.
3.  **Core Curriculum Requirements:** The 16-year mandate must holistically cover:
    *   **STEM Mastery:** Rigorous Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.
    *   **Polyglot Fluency:** Mandatory instruction in multiple languages.
    *   **Civic and Moral Philosophy:** Understanding the foundational decrees, ethics, and theology of the Nation.

## Section 102: Integrated Job Training & Early Labor
1.  **The "Experience Gap" Eradication:** The State strictly prohibits the graduation of citizens with zero practical work experience, moral grounding, or work ethic.
2.  **Mandatory Employment Integration:** Practical job training and part-time employment are integral, non-negotiable components of the Sovereign Education system, commencing as early as Kindergarten.
3.  **Age-Appropriate Labor:**
    *   **Childhood (Ages 5-13):** Students must hold age-appropriate, part-time "jobs" within the school or local community (e.g., janitorial duties, agricultural assistance, basic administrative tasks) to instill early responsibility, discipline, and the direct correlation between labor and reward.
    *   **Apprenticeship (Ages 14-21):** Students must be formally integrated into the Sovereign Labor Guilds or private sector via part-time employment, ensuring they graduate with a resume of tangible, taxable work experience.

## Section 103: The Hardness Doctrine (Survival, Self-Defense, & First Aid)
1.  **Compulsory Readiness:** Every citizen must be physically and mentally capable of surviving and thriving in emergency situations, whether domestic (within the Sovereign borders) or external (in foreign or hostile territories).
2.  **Core Disciplines:** The education system must mandate rigorous, graded instruction in:
    *   **Self-Defense & Combatives:** Unarmed and armed defense against hostile aggression.
    *   **Wilderness & Urban Survival:** Foraging, shelter building, firecraft, water purification, and navigation.
    *   **Advanced First Aid:** Trauma care, triage, and emergency medicine (TCCC standard or equivalent).
3.  **The Annual Recertification Mandate:** Survival and self-defense are perishable skills. All adult citizens must undergo and pass an **Annual Recertification** in these three core disciplines to maintain their standing.

## Section 104: The Festival of Booths (The Sukkot Survival Exercise)
1.  **The Adoption of Sukkot:** The Sovereign Digital Nation formally adopts the Biblical Jewish tradition of the *Festival of Booths* (Sukkot) as a mandatory, nationwide survival and readiness exercise.
2.  **The National Halt:** For seven (7) consecutive days each year, the Nation shall declare a mandatory halt to all non-essential commercial labor and administrative duties.
3.  **The Wilderness Mandate:** During this week, all citizens—regardless of class, wealth, or status—are legally required to vacate their permanent residences. They must construct and live in temporary shelters (booths/tents) exposed to the elements.
4.  **The Purpose:** This is an engineered, annual stress-test designed to:
    *   **Simulate Emergency Displacement:** Train the populace to rapidly mobilize, build shelter, and survive outside of modern comforts.
    *   **Enforce Self-Reliance:** Practice the survival skills mandated in Section 103.
    *   **Foster Humility & Unity:** Remind the Nation of its dependence on God and the fragility of man-made structures, stripping away the illusions of permanent safety.
