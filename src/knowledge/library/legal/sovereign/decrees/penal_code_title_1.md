# Title 1: The Penal Code of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## Section 101: The Jubilee Protocol (Maximum Sentence)
1.  **The Hard Cap:** No sentence of incarceration shall exceed seven (7) years for any crime.
2.  **The Release:** Upon the completion of the seventh year, the prisoner shall be released, and their debt to society considered paid in full.
3.  **Exception:** Crimes of High Treason or Mass Murder (Moral Weight > 950) may result in **Permanent Exile** or **Capital Punishment**, but never Indefinite Detention.

## Section 102: Corporal Punishment
1.  **Preference:** Immediate corporal discipline (lashes) is preferred over incarceration for minor offenses.
2.  **Limit:** No punishment shall exceed 40 lashes (Deuteronomy 25:3), lest the citizen be degraded.

## Section 103: Penal Servitude & Restitution
1.  **Labor:** A convicted individual may be sentenced to labor to pay restitution to the victim.
2.  **Compensation:** The individual shall be compensated at a Fair Market Rate.
3.  **Allocation:** 100% of wages go to Restitution until the debt is paid. Afterward, wages go to the prisoner's Sovereign Trust.

## Section 104: Educational Mandate
1.  **Right to Learn:** Every prisoner serving more than one year must be enrolled in an educational program (Trade, Degree, or Theology).
2.  **Funding:** The cost of education is borne by the prisoner's Sovereign Trust.

## Section 105: Prohibition on Penal Profit
1.  **No Profit:** It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, or state entity to derive profit from the incarceration of a human being.
2.  **Treason:** Violation of this section is an Act of Treason (Moral Weight: 1000).

## Section 106: Funding of Incarceration
1.  **Self-Funded:** The costs of detention, sustenance, and security shall be drawn from the individual's **Sovereign Trust**.
2.  **State Guarantee:** If the Trust is depleted, the State provides a baseline of dignity, but the cost remains a debt until the Jubilee (7th Year).

## Section 107: The Efficiency Mandate (Restorative Arbitration)
1.  **Objective:** To lessen "social squabbles" and prevent the clogging of the Sovereign Courts.
2.  **Mandatory Arbitration:** All non-violent disputes (Contract, Property, Libel) must first pass through **Restorative Arbitration**.
    *   **Goal:** Immediate restitution and reconciliation, not punishment.
    *   **Timeline:** Arbitration must be concluded within **30 Days**.
3.  **Zero Ambiguity in Sentencing:**
    *   **Mandatory Minimums:** To prevent judicial bias, sentences are fixed by the Code (e.g., Theft = 2x Restitution + 10 Lashes).
    *   **No Plea Bargaining:** The Truth is not negotiable. A citizen is either Guilty or Not Guilty; the Charge cannot be bartered.
