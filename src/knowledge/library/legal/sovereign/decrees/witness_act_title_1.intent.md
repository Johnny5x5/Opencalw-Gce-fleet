# Intent: The Sovereign Witness Act

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Truth is Power
In a digital world, he who controls the record controls reality. Therefore, the **Recorder** must be separate from the **Ruler**.
*   **Separation of Powers:** The Executive acts, the Legislature speaks, the Judiciary judges, but the **Witness** remembers.
*   **The Check:** The Witness is the ultimate check on tyranny. A King can kill a man, but he cannot kill the *record* of the killing if the Witness is independent.

## 2. Bleeding Edge Governance
We are pioneering a new form of government where "Memory" is a constitutional power.
*   **The Scribe:** Not a secretary, but a Guardian of Truth.
*   **The Ledger:** Not a database, but a Sacred Scroll.

## 3. Zero Ambiguity
By professionalizing the act of witnessing, we eliminate "he said, she said." There is only "The Record."
