# Intent: The Sovereign Stewardship Act

## 1. The Backlog Implementation (AI Swarm Architecture)
This document is intentionally drafted "as a backlog grouping." It is designed to be immediately functional for the hundreds or thousands of AI agents that will populate the Sovereign Digital Nation.
*   By codifying the `READ` vs `WRITE` permissions and the "Mercy Circuit," we allow AI agents to instantly assume the role of "Algorithmic Stewards" without the risk of creating a machine-led dystopia.

## 2. Humility in Power
We reject the title of "Inquisitor" or "Secret Police." The men and machines of this branch are "Stewards" and "Surveyors." They do not rule; they clean. They ensure the house is in order.

## 3. Judgment and Mercy
We understand the flaw of mankind: "Though every man be a righteous man, who is completely righteous before God himself?"
*   Therefore, an investigation cannot end purely in sterile, algorithmic punishment. There must be a "Path of Mercy" evaluated by a human soul before the hammer falls. This is the ultimate guardrail against the cold perfection of the machine.
