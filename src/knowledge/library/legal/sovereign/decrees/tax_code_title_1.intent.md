# Intent: The Sovereign Tax & Growth Act

## 1. The Problem
High taxes and inheritance taxes destroy generational wealth and drive capital away. Conversely, "race to the bottom" tax havens often lack moral standards.

## 2. The Goal
We aim to create a **High-Growth, High-Morality Economy**:
*   **Attract Capital:** Low corporate taxes (3-5%) pull the world's biggest companies to our Nation.
*   **Enforce Morality:** We use the low tax as a "carrot" to enforce the "stick" of the Corporate Covenant (No Usury).
*   **Build Dynasties:** A 0% percentage-based inheritance tax ensures families can build multi-generational strength. The flat "Token Tax" (one Grand Note per year of the estate) ensures the bureaucratic labor of the transfer is paid for without cannibalizing the estate's wealth.

## 3. The Limitation
The reduced corporate rates are a **Privilege, not a Right.** They are contingent on strict adherence to the Covenant. If a corporation acts with "Evil" (Moral Weight > 800), it loses its charter, regardless of how much tax it pays.
