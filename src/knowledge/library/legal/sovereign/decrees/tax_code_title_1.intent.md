# Intent: The Sovereign Tax & Growth Act

## 1. The Core Philosophy: The 10-Generation Horizon
The Tax Code is not merely a mechanism for funding the government; it is the **Architectural Blueprint for Eternity**.
*   **The Foundation:** The "10-Generation Investment Horizon" is the root law. Every dollar collected is a seed planted for a harvest 300 years in the future.
*   **The Effect:** This law cascades down to every aspect of society—Welfare, Labor, Family Structure, and Corporate Governance. We do not plan for quarters; we plan for centuries.

## 2. The Estate Mandate: Zero Ambiguity
Death is inevitable, but chaos is not.
*   **Efficiency:** The transition of assets and power upon death must be as instant and seamless as a digital transaction.
*   **The Living Will:** We do not allow citizens to "drift" into ambiguity. Every citizen must have a clear, legally binding plan for their estate and their own incapacitation.
*   **Peace:** By mandating clear succession, we eliminate the family feuds that destroy generational wealth.

## 3. The Goal: High-Growth, High-Morality
We aim to create a **High-Growth, High-Morality Economy**:
*   **Attract Capital:** Low corporate taxes (3-5%) pull the world's biggest companies to our Nation.
*   **Enforce Morality:** We use the low tax as a "carrot" to enforce the "stick" of the Corporate Covenant (No Usury).
*   **Build Dynasties:** No inheritance tax ensures families can build multi-generational strength.

## 4. The Household Standard
The fundamental economic unit of the Nation is not the individual, but the **Household**.
*   **Unified Strength:** Taxes are levied on the household to encourage family unity and shared economic goals.
*   **The Family Estate:** Wages from state service (like Co-Teaching) are not spending money; they are seed capital for the family's long-term sovereignty, locked into the 10-Generation Horizon.

## 5. The Universal Application
This philosophy applies to all:
*   **Citizens:** Their taxes build the Sovereign Trust.
*   **Non-Citizens:** Their labor feeds the engine that sustains the stability they enjoy.
*   **Corporations:** Their profits fuel the society that grants them charter.
