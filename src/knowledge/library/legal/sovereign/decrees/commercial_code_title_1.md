# Title 1: The Sovereign Commercial Code

## Section 101: The Bifurcation of Commerce
1.  **Two Worlds:** The Commercial Law of the Sovereign Digital Nation is explicitly divided into two distinct jurisdictions: **Domestic Jurisdiction** (Native) and **Foreign Jurisdiction** (International).
2.  **The Origin Test:** The classification of a business transaction is determined by the **Origin Test** defined in the Tax Code (Section 109).

## Section 102: Domestic Jurisdiction (The Family Track)
1.  **Philosophy:** Commerce between Sovereign Citizens and Native Corporations is viewed as "Family Business." It is high-trust, cooperative, and governed by the **Corporate Covenant** (Biblical Laws of Commerce).
2.  **Dispute Resolution:** All Domestic commercial disputes must first pass through **Restorative Arbitration** (Penal Code Section 107). The goal is reconciliation and continuity of the relationship.
3.  **Prohibitions:** Usury, predatory pricing, and "sharp practice" are strictly prohibited in Domestic commerce.
4.  **The Standard:** The spirit of the law ("Fairness") supersedes the letter of the contract.

## Section 103: Foreign Jurisdiction (The International Track)
1.  **Philosophy:** Commerce involving Foreign Entities is viewed as "Merchant Business." It is low-trust, adversarial, and governed by strict **Contract Law**.
2.  **Adoption of the UCC:** For all transactions within the Foreign Jurisdiction, the Nation formally adopts the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** as the baseline legal standard, unless specifically overridden by Sovereign Decree.
3.  **The High Court of Foreign Commerce:** Disputes involving Foreign entities are heard in this specialized court, which operates under strict procedural rules (Admiralty Style).
4.  **Litigation Bonds:** Before a Foreign Entity may file suit against a Native Entity, it must post a **Litigation Bond** equal to 150% of the claimed damages to cover potential counter-claims and legal fees.
5.  **Burden of Proof:** In the Foreign Jurisdiction, the burden of proof is strictly on the claimant. The "Benefit of the Doubt" belongs to the Sovereign Citizen.

## Section 104: The Anti-Extortion Protocol (Price Gouging)
1.  **The Principle:** Profit is a righteous reward for value creation. Extortion is a crime against the community.
2.  **The Emergency Trigger (The American Standard):**
    *   **Definition:** During a formally declared **State of Emergency** (War, Natural Disaster, Famine).
    *   **Expanded Essentials:** For the purposes of this Code, "Essential Goods" explicitly include: Food, Water, Fuel, Medical Supplies, Shelter, and **Digital Infrastructure (Bandwidth & Compute Power)**.
    *   **The Cap:** It is illegal to sell or offer to sell any Essential Good for a price exceeding **15% above the 30-day pre-emergency average** for that good.
3.  **Algorithmic Extortion (Surge Pricing):**
    *   **The Limit:** Automated "Surge Pricing" algorithms used by any entity (transportation, ticketing, logistics) are legally capped. An algorithm may not increase the price of a standard service by more than **200% (2x)** of its baseline rate, regardless of demand spikes.
    *   **Reasoning:** To prevent machines from capitalizing on micro-crises (e.g., weather events) to extort the citizenry.
4.  **Anti-Cartel and Tacit Collusion (The Shadow Board):**
    *   **Artificial Scarcity:** The deliberate withholding of goods or services to artificially inflate prices is classified as **Commercial Treason**.
    *   **Tacit Collusion:** If multiple dominant corporations simultaneously raise prices across an industry sector without a verified supply-side shock, the **Office of the Witness** shall presume the existence of a "Shadow Board" (Tacit Cartel) and trigger an immediate **Inquisition** into their ledgers.
5.  **Penalty:** Violation of the Anti-Extortion Protocol results in the immediate confiscation of the offending inventory (or corresponding capital) and a punitive fine equal to **Three Times (3x) the gross revenue** generated during the gouging period.

## Section 105: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
