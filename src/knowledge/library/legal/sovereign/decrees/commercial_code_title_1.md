# Title 1: The Sovereign Commercial Code

## Section 101: The Bifurcation of Commerce
1.  **Two Worlds:** The Commercial Law of the Sovereign Digital Nation is explicitly divided into two distinct jurisdictions: **Domestic Jurisdiction** (Native) and **Foreign Jurisdiction** (International).
2.  **The Origin Test:** The classification of a business transaction is determined by the **Origin Test** defined in the Tax Code (Section 109).

## Section 102: Domestic Jurisdiction (The Family Track)
1.  **Philosophy:** Commerce between Sovereign Citizens and Native Corporations is viewed as "Family Business." It is high-trust, cooperative, and governed by the **Corporate Covenant** (Biblical Laws of Commerce).
2.  **Dispute Resolution:** All Domestic commercial disputes must first pass through **Restorative Arbitration** (Penal Code Section 107). The goal is reconciliation and continuity of the relationship.
3.  **Prohibitions:** Usury, predatory pricing, and "sharp practice" are strictly prohibited in Domestic commerce.
4.  **The Standard:** The spirit of the law ("Fairness") supersedes the letter of the contract.

## Section 103: Foreign Jurisdiction (The International Track)
1.  **Philosophy:** Commerce involving Foreign Entities is viewed as "Merchant Business." It is low-trust, adversarial, and governed by strict **Contract Law**.
2.  **Adoption of the UCC:** For all transactions within the Foreign Jurisdiction, the Nation formally adopts the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** as the baseline legal standard, unless specifically overridden by Sovereign Decree.
3.  **The High Court of Foreign Commerce:** Disputes involving Foreign entities are heard in this specialized court, which operates under strict procedural rules (Admiralty Style).
4.  **Litigation Bonds:** Before a Foreign Entity may file suit against a Native Entity, it must post a **Litigation Bond** equal to 150% of the claimed damages to cover potential counter-claims and legal fees.
5.  **Burden of Proof:** In the Foreign Jurisdiction, the burden of proof is strictly on the claimant. The "Benefit of the Doubt" belongs to the Sovereign Citizen.

## Section 104: The Anti-Extortion Protocol (Price Gouging)
1.  **The Principle:** Profit is a righteous reward for value creation. Extortion is a crime against the community.
2.  **The Emergency Trigger (The American Standard):**
    *   **Definition:** During a formally declared **State of Emergency** (War, Natural Disaster, Famine).
    *   **The Cap:** It is illegal to sell or offer to sell any "Essential Good" (food, water, fuel, medical supplies, shelter) for a price exceeding **15% above the 30-day pre-emergency average** for that good.
3.  **Ongoing Prohibition (The Sovereign Standard):**
    *   **Artificial Scarcity:** The deliberate withholding of goods (cartel behavior) to artificially inflate prices outside of an emergency is classified as **Commercial Treason**.
    *   **Surveillance:** The **Office of the Witness (Order of Auditors)** is mandated to monitor the Sovereign Ledger to detect algorithmic price gouging or sudden, unjustified spikes in the cost of living.
4.  **Penalty:** Violation of the Anti-Extortion Protocol results in the immediate confiscation of the offending inventory and a fine of 3x the extorted profit.

## Section 105: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
