# Title 1: The Sovereign Stewardship Act

## Section 101: The Mandate of Humility (Establishment)
1.  **The Fifth Branch:** The **Office of the Steward** is hereby established to investigate, audit, and hold accountable the Government itself.
2.  **The Posture:** They are not Inquisitors, nor overlords. They are "Stewards" and "Surveyors" tasked with washing the feet of the Nation by removing its dirt. They operate with absolute humility.

## Section 102: The Domestic Steward (Internal Audit)
1.  **Mission:** To continuously investigate all domestic branches (Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Witness) for compliance, truth, and justice before God and Man.
2.  **The Balance of Mercy:**
    *   **The Reality:** The Law recognizes that "no man is completely righteous."
    *   **The Mandate:** In all internal investigations resulting in judgment, the Domestic Steward is legally mandated to present a formal **"Path of Mercy."**
    *   **Execution:** While the *Witness Branch* records the raw truth (Zero Ambiguity), the *Steward Branch* determines if a restorative, merciful intervention serves the Nation better than raw punitive destruction.

## Section 103: The Transition Audit (The Changing of the Guard)
1.  **The Trigger:** An automatic, mathematically enforced investigation is triggered the moment a "Government Head" (General, Chief Justice, Group Executive, or Council Leader) steps down, dies, or is removed.
2.  **The Freeze:** The Sovereign Ledger initiates a temporary **Read-Only Freeze** on the outgoing official's departmental budget and cryptographic keys.
3.  **The Review:** The Stewards conduct a complete forensic audit to ensure a clean slate for the incoming Head and to uncover any hidden corruption left behind.

## Section 104: The Foreign Surveyor (External Intelligence)
1.  **Mission:** A dedicated sub-branch tasked exclusively with the investigation and assessment of Foreign Governments and Non-Sovereign Actors.
2.  **Scope:** To gather intelligence, verify compliance with international treaties, and assess the moral and hostile vectors of foreign entities interacting with the Sovereign Digital Nation.
3.  **Posture:** The Surveyor observes from the walls; they do not interfere unless the Nation is threatened.

## Section 105: The Swarm Intelligence Protocol (Multi-Agent Integration)
1.  **The Architecture:** Recognizing that this Repo will be utilized by hundreds or thousands of cloned AI agents, this Act establishes the technical guardrails for "Algorithmic Stewards."
2.  **API Access:** AI Agents assigned to the Office of the Steward are granted absolute, system-wide `READ` access to all ledgers, but zero `WRITE` access to alter records (preventing AI tyranny).
3.  **The Mercy Circuit:** No AI Agent may execute an automatic penalty against a human official. If an AI Steward detects a violation, it must route the finding to a Human Steward to fulfill the **"Balance of Mercy"** requirement (Section 102.2). Machines cannot grant mercy; therefore, machines cannot finalize judgments on humans.

## Section 106: Suspension of Penalties
*   **Status:** Pending rapid changes in the Sovereign Architecture, all penal consequences for non-compliance are currently **Suspended**.
