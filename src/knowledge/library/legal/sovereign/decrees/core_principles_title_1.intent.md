# Intent: The Core Principles of the Sovereign Nation

## 1. The Salt of the Earth
Every complex system needs a bedrock. Without it, judges (human or machine) are forced to use "brain power" to interpret vague laws, leading to bias, corruption, and the slow decay of the nation.
*   **The Four Principles** are the salt. They flavor every interaction. They are designed to be so simple and absolute that a machine can execute them without hesitation, and a human judge cannot evade them.

## 2. The Cultural Operating System (Kaizen)
We recognize that you cannot legislate morality or effort. You cannot throw a man in jail for being mediocre.
*   Therefore, **Kaizen** (Continuous Improvement) is placed here not as a penal code, but as the *Cultural Operating System* of the Nation. It is the North Star for generations to come: always be improving.

## 3. The Ultimate Guardrail
We are building a Digital Nation. The AI that runs our infrastructure (Mobius Engine, Library, Defense) must have a soul. These principles are that soul. They are the hardcoded limiters that prevent the machine from choosing efficiency over justice, or short-term gains over the 10-Generation horizon.
