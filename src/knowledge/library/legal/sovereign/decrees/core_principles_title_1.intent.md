# Intent: The Core Principles of the Sovereign Nation

## 1. The Salt of the Earth
Every complex system needs a bedrock. Without it, judges (human or machine) are forced to use "brain power" to interpret vague laws, leading to bias, corruption, and the slow decay of the nation.
*   **The Seven Principles** are the salt. They flavor every interaction. They are designed to be so simple and absolute that a machine can execute them without hesitation, and a human judge cannot evade them.

## 2. The Chain of Command (The Divine Hierarchy)
The State is not God, nor is it the Father. We explicitly reject the Totalitarian impulse to replace the Family with the State.
*   The State exists to build walls around the Garden (The Family) so that the Family may serve God. Any attempt by the State to break into the Garden and usurp the Head of the Household is a violation of the First Principle.

## 3. The Cultural Operating System (Kaizen)
We recognize that you cannot legislate morality or effort. You cannot throw a man in jail for being mediocre.
*   Therefore, **Kaizen** (Continuous Improvement) is placed here not as a penal code, but as the *Cultural Operating System* of the Nation. It is the North Star for generations to come: always be improving.

## 4. The Ultimate Guardrail
We are building a Digital Nation. The AI that runs our infrastructure (Mobius Engine, Library, Defense) must have a soul. These principles are that soul. They are the hardcoded limiters that prevent the machine from choosing efficiency over justice, or short-term gains over the 10-Generation horizon.
