# Title 1: The Sovereign Corporate Code

## Section 101: The Privilege of Incorporation
The act of incorporation within the Sovereign Digital Nation is a privilege, not a right. It is granted strictly under the condition of the **Sovereign Covenant** (adherence to Biblical Commerce: No Usury, Fair Weights, Sabbath Rest).

## Section 102: The Corporate Death Penalty (Revocation of Charter)
If a Corporation is found guilty of a Major Moral Infraction (e.g., Predatory Usury, Slavery, Deceitful Algorithmic Weights) with a Moral Vector exceeding 800, it shall face the **Corporate Death Penalty**.
The entity's charter shall be immediately revoked, and it shall cease to exist as a protected entity.

## Section 103: The Impoundment Protocol (Due Process)
To prevent capital flight during an investigation:
1.  **The Freeze:** Upon formal accusation by the War Council or Auditors, the assets of the Corporation shall be impounded by a State Trustee.
2.  **Operations:** Normal operations (payroll, essential services) may continue to prevent harm to innocent workers.
3.  **The 6-Month Grace Period:** The trial and audit must conclude within six (6) months. If guilt is not proven within this timeframe, all assets are released with damages paid by the accuser.

## Section 104: Double Restitution & Expulsion
Upon a guilty verdict resulting in Charter Revocation:
1.  **Liquidation:** Assets are liquidated strictly to pay **Double Restitution** to the victims of the infraction.
2.  **Shareholder Return:** The State shall not profit from the dissolution. Any remaining surplus assets or capital, after restitution is paid, shall be returned to the shareholders.
3.  **The Ban:** The entity, its intellectual property, and its executive directors are permanently expelled from the Sovereign Network.
