# Title: The Sovereign Energy Rights & Stewardship Act

## Section 1: Definition of Terms
1.  **Energy Production:** The generation of electrical or thermal energy from any source (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Fossil Fuel, Nuclear).
2.  **Commercial Provider:** Any entity generating energy for the purpose of sale or distribution to the grid.
3.  **Personal Generation:** The generation of energy by an individual for their own consumption or property use.
4.  **Jubilee Year:** Every seventh (7th) year in the Sovereign Calendar, designated as a year of efficiency audit and maintenance.
5.  **Grand Jubilee Year:** Every fiftieth (50th) year in the Sovereign Calendar.

## Section 2: Personal Energy Rights
1.  **Right to Generate:** Every citizen has the absolute right to generate, store, and consume energy from renewable sources (Solar, Wind, Geothermal) on their property.
2.  **Grid Independence:** The right to disconnect from the public grid is guaranteed. No citizen shall be forced to connect.
3.  **No Tax on Sunlight:** No tax, fee, or penalty shall be levied on the personal capture of sunlight, wind, or geothermal heat.

## Section 3: The Jubilee Audit (Commercial)
1.  **Maintenance Focus:** During a Jubilee Year (Year 7, 14, 21, etc.), all **Commercial Providers** must prioritize grid maintenance, efficiency upgrades, and waste reduction over expansion.
2.  **Audit Mandate:** A comprehensive audit of all commercial energy infrastructure is conducted to ensure compliance with sustainability standards.
3.  **Output Cap:** Commercial energy output is capped at the previous year's average, preventing expansion during the rest year.

## Section 4: The Grand Jubilee Reset
1.  **Legacy Retirement:** During a Grand Jubilee Year (Year 50, 100, etc.), all energy infrastructure older than 50 years must be reviewed for retirement or replacement with cleaner technology.
2.  **Generational Planning:** This ensures that the energy grid evolves with technology and does not become a burden on future generations.

## Section 5: Enforcement & Penalties
1.  **Interference Violation:** Any attempt by a commercial entity or local authority to prevent a citizen from generating their own energy is a violation of Liberty (Moral Weight: 900).
2.  **Penalty:** Immediate fine of 10x the potential energy savings, paid to the citizen.
3.  **Audit Failure:** Failure to conduct the Jubilee Audit results in a suspension of commercial operating licenses.
