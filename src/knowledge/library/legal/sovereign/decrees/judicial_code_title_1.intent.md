# Intent: The Sovereign Judicial Code

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Justice is Divine
Justice is not a human invention; it is a divine attribute.
*   **Providence:** We recognize that human judgment is flawed. The **Trial of Providence (Dice Protocol)** is a mechanism to allow the "Randomness of the Universe" (God's Will) to tip the scales in cases of deep ambiguity or moral weight.
*   **Retribution:** For crimes of negligence that harm the body, the punishment must fit the crime. The Dice determine if the offender must walk in the victim's shoes.

## 2. Certainty over Probability
We reject the "Preponderance of Evidence." A man's life cannot be ruined by a "maybe."
*   **Two Witnesses:** We return to the ancient standard. Corroboration is essential.
*   **Digital Truth:** In the digital age, the "Ledger" is the ultimate witness.

## 3. Justice is Blind (The American/Biblical Synthesis)
We inherit the greatest legal tradition of the West: the blindfold.
*   **Impartiality:** The law does not care if you are a General or an Apprentice. Status is irrelevant to truth.
*   **The Digital Blindfold:** While human judges struggle with unconscious bias, our algorithms do not. By mathematically redacting status before a case is read, we enforce the Biblical mandate: "You shall hear the small and the great alike."
