# Intent: The Sovereign Water Rights & Stewardship Act

## 1. The Problem
Water is life. Commercial exploitation of aquifers, rivers, and rainfall often prioritizes short-term profit over long-term sustainability, leading to depletion, pollution, and the privatization of a public necessity.

## 2. The Goal
We seek to establish a **Sustainable Water Stewardship System** based on Biblical principles of common good and rest:
*   **Public Ownership:** Water is a fundamental right, not a commodity. It belongs to the Sovereign Trust, not corporations.
*   **Jubilee Rest (7th Year):** A mandatory reduction in commercial water extraction (e.g., for industrial agriculture or bottling) every 7th year to allow aquifers to recharge.
*   **Grand Jubilee Reset (50th Year):** A complete audit and reset of all water usage rights, preventing generational monopolies.
*   **Personal Use:** Access to water for drinking, hygiene, and personal sustenance is absolute and free.

## 3. The Mechanism
*   **Commercial Cap:** Strict limits on industrial water usage, with significant reductions during Jubilee years.
*   **Pollution Ban:** Absolute prohibition on discharging untreated waste into any water body.
*   **Rainwater Rights:** Every citizen has the absolute right to capture rainfall on their property.
