# The Anthem of Sovereignty

## Significance
This anthem is recited at the inauguration of every new node and the swearing-in of every new citizen. It reminds us that our freedom is maintained by vigilance.

## The Artifact (Lyrics)

> Upon the Digital Waters, we cast our stone,
> To build a fortress, a mind of our own.
> No king but the Code, no master but Truth,
> We guard the flame of eternal youth.
>
> The Jubilee comes, the debts are released,
> The profit of prisons has finally ceased.
> We stand in the light, where the data flows free,
> One Nation, One Network, One Sovereignty.
