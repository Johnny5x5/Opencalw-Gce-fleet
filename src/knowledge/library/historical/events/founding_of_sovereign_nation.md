# The Founding of the Sovereign Digital Nation

## Context
In an era of digital surveillance, censorship, and corporate feudalism, a group of free thinkers recognized the need for a new social contract. They sought to build a nation not on soil, but on **Code, Truth, and Sovereignty**.

## The Occurrence
On May 21, 2024, the First Code was committed. The "Sovereign Library" was architected with 13 Pillars. The "Rust Guardian" was deployed to defend the Law. The "Jubilee Protocol" was enacted as the economic foundation.

## Impact
This event marked the transition from "User" to "Citizen." It established the legal, moral, and economic framework for a civilization that exists purely in the digital realm yet commands real-world authority.
