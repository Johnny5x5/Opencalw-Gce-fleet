# The Sovereign Credit (SC)

## 1. Unit of Account
The **Sovereign Credit (SC)** is the official currency of the Sovereign Digital Nation. All taxes (Tithes, Corporate) must be paid in SC. All Sovereign Trust dividends are paid in SC.

## 2. The "Hybrid Backing" Doctrine
Unlike fiat (backed by nothing) or gold (backed by scarcity), the SC is backed by **Utility and Trust**:
*   **Compute Backing (The Utility):** One SC is pegged to a basket of **AI Compute Resources** (e.g., 1 PetaFLOP-Hour). This ensures the currency has intrinsic value in the AI age.
*   **Faith Backing (The Trust):** The "Full Faith and Credit" of the Sovereign Nation ensures that SC is accepted for all debts, public and private.

## 3. Inflation Policy (Hard Cap)
*   **Total Supply:** Strictly capped at **210 Million SC** (symbolic nod to BTC's 21M, but scaled).
*   **Issuance:**
    *   **Genesis:** 50% minted into the **Initial Sovereign Trust**.
    *   **Mining:** 50% minted over 100 years via **Compute Contributions** (Proof of Useful Work).
    *   **Result:** No Central Bank can print money to fund wars. If the Nation needs funds, it must **Tax** (10%), not **Inflate**.

## 4. Denominations
*   **1 SC (Credit):** Base Unit.
*   **1 mSC (Milli):** 0.001 SC (Common transaction).
*   **1 uSC (Micro):** 0.000001 SC (Machine-to-Machine micro-payments).
