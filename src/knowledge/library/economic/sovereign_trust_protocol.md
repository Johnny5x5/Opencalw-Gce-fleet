# The Sovereign Trust Protocol (The Birthright)

## Core Value
The Sovereign Trust is the **Foundational Economic Unit** of the Nation. It is not "welfare"; it is an **Equity Stake** in the Nation itself, granted to every citizen at birth (or naturalization).

## Allocation Mechanism
1.  **Initial Endowment:** Upon registration of a Citizen Identity (DID), the Treasury mints a fixed sum of Sovereign Credits (e.g., 10,000 SC) into a locked Trust Account.
2.  **Growth:** The Trust is invested in the **National Infrastructure Fund** (bridges, servers, AI compute), earning compound interest from the nation's GDP growth.

## Usage Rights
1.  **Restricted Access:** The principal cannot be withdrawn for frivolous consumption.
2.  **Authorized Draws:**
    *   **Education:** Tuition for approved skills (Trade/University).
    *   **Health:** Critical medical procedures.
    *   **Housing:** First-time home purchase (down payment).
    *   **Justice:** Funding for legal defense or restitution (if incarcerated).

## The Jubilee Provision
If a citizen falls into debt or crime, their Trust acts as their **Safety Net**. It pays their restitution. If the Trust hits zero, the State provides a floor, but the citizen enters "Debt Servitude" (Labor) until the Jubilee (7th Year).
