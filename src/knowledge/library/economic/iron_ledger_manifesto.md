# The Iron Ledger Manifesto

## 1. Immutable History
We reject the "Fuzzy Accounting" of the fiat world. In the Sovereign Digital Nation, **Every Transaction is an Event.** It is cryptographically signed, timestamped, and immutable.

## 2. Double-Entry + Time
Traditional accounting is Double-Entry (Debit/Credit). The Iron Ledger is **Triple-Entry** (Debit/Credit/Receipt). The "Receipt" is a cryptographic proof signed by both parties and notarized by the Network.

## 3. Radical Transparency
*   **Public Funds:** All government spending is visible on the public chain in real-time. (No "Black Budgets" without War Council override).
*   **Private Funds:** Citizen transactions are **Private by Default** (using Zero-Knowledge Proofs) but **Auditable by Warrant** (if a crime is proven).

## 4. Code is Settlement
Contracts are not "papers to be sued over"; they are **Smart Contracts** that self-execute.
*   "If delivery is verified by Oracle, release payment."
*   "If loan is defaulted, liquidate collateral."
This eliminates the friction of courts for 99% of disputes.
