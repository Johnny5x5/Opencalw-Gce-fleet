# The Law of Compute Abundance

## Abstract
As Moore's Law slows, Specialized Compute (ASICs, NPUs) accelerates. We hypothesize that compute cost will approach zero for specialized tasks (inference), while general-purpose compute remains scarce.

## Methodology
Analyzing price/performance trends of NVIDIA H100s vs. specialized Groq LPUs over 5 years.

## Implication for Sovereign Nation
We must invest in **Specialized Infrastructure** to secure our economic backing (Sovereign Credit).
