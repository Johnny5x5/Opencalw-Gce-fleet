# The Joseph Grain Protocol

## Overview
Inspired by Genesis 41, this protocol mandates the **Storage of 20% of all caloric output** for times of famine.

## Method
1.  **Silo Construction:** Build hermetically sealed silos (See Engineering Library).
2.  **Rotation:** Rotate stock every 3 years to ensure freshness.
3.  **Distribution:** In times of crisis, grain is released via the **Sovereign Trust** mechanism.
