# The Iron Dome Doctrine

## Objective
To create an impenetrable "Digital Shield" around the Sovereign Network (10.0.0.0/8), ensuring 100% uptime and 0% data exfiltration.

## Strategy: "The AI-First Defense"
We do not rely on static firewalls. We use **Autonomous AI Sentinels** (See `SecuritySentinel`) to patrol the network.

## Tactics
1.  **The 12nm Firewall:** Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on all ingress traffic.
2.  **The Immune System:** Host-based anomaly detection (The Watcher) on every node.
3.  **Active Defense:** If an attack is detected, the Iron Dome automatically shunts the attacker to a "Honeypot" and updates the global `hosts.deny` list.
4.  **Threat Intel:** Ingestion of global feeds (CISA, Google SCC) to predict attacks before they happen.
